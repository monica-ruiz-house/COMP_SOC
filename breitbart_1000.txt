friday at the aspen security forum msnbcs andrea mitchell interviewed former obama administration national security adviser susan rice mitchell asked the president the white house was inviting vladimir putin to a return summit the national security advisor had not known about it and to the best of my reporting the secretary of state had not been informed of that as well there was no discussion it was basically putin to trump to sarah sanders send out a tweet how damaging is that in terms of the way we conduct foreign policy the way other leaders view the opportunity to exploit and flatter this president into making snap decisions rice said the president wakes up and does whatever the hell he wants to do on any given day on any given moment without the benefit of the input and wisdom of his experts on the national security team and the experts in the interagency and that is exceedingly dangerous and it makes him very malleable it makes him subject to his own whims and also the manipulations of adversary and friends alike follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

during wednesdays broadcast of fox news channels fox news  night sen ted cruz r tx argued democrats politicians in some of americas cities and states were allowing protests to get out of control because they saw it as in their political best interest to allow the mob to carry out their violence he explained that he was offering legislation that would allow for increased damages if citizens were denied police protection and that resulted in injuries to person or property you know this is a really tough time for our country right now he said were seeing riots across the country were seeing violence and police cars being firebombed police officers being murdered and violent mobs within our cities but even worse in the face of that were also seeing democratic politicians  democratic mayors democratic governors  who have somehow made the decision its in their political best interest to allow the mob to carry out their violence and theyre refusing to protect their own citizens theyre allowing these lawless autonomous zones to exist within their boundaries that has never happened in modern times and so i introduced this week legislation that if an elected official wrongfully denies their citizens the right to police protection in the situation of a riot that you can sue them and get triple damages for any injuries you suffer or for any damage to your home or your business cruz continued and a lot of these democratic politicians sat by as small businesses were looted and burned to the ground many of those small business owners were african american or hispanics but the democratic politicians didnt care it was in their  what they defined as their partisan interest to allow the mob to rage thats  thats not right cruz said the federal government was justified to react when federal property was threatened he offered examples in american history of federal intervention in instances of civil unrest you know this shouldnt be complicated cruz said these are pretty simple rules in life dont physically hurt somebody else dont assault somebody else dont burn their business to the ground dont murder somebody else but yet the violent mobs arent following that and in this instance  so whats happened is these mobs are attacking federal buildings theyre attacking federal courthouses now it ought to be real simple if you attack a federal courthouse the answer ought to be  youre going to be arrested youre going to be put in jail youre going to stay in jail a long time its real simple dont attack a federal courthouse well what the federal government is quite reasonably doing is sending federal law enforcement agencies to protect federal buildings protect federal courthouses and ive never seen anything like it he continued actually  you know what i said never seen anything like it yes  yes i have what these democrats are doing is the same thing we saw democrats do in the s and s its the same thing democratic politicians like bull connor did its the same thing that you saw democratic racists who didnt want to segregate schools  and remember eisenhower sent in the army and said youre going to follow youre going to follow brown versus board of education and you had elected democrats and they were all democrats who were enforcing jim crow who said get your federal officers out of here well guess what cruz added you dont have the ability to throw the federal government out you dont have the ability to throw federal law enforcement officers out and you certainly dont have the ability to say were going to allow the federal courthouse or the federal building to burn you know what if the chicago mayor wants to allow the mob to rampage in city hall and occupy her office thats  thats her decision knock yourself out if you want to give in to the lawlessness but she doesnt have the right to give up the federal courthouse and neither does the mayor of portland or the governor of oregon or any of these democrats who theyve made a decision the police are the enemy and the mob are their allies and its just  its wrong follow jeff poor on twitter jeffpoor please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

an islamic school in east london has failed a government inspection after literature promoting inequality of women and punishments including stoning to death was found in the library which could unwittingly promote extremism the private jamiatul ummah school teaches  boys aged  to  in london borough of tower hamlets which became the first muslim majority borough in britain to elect a now disgraced muslim mayor in  the governments chief inspector sir michael wilshaw identified the school as one of six independent islamic teaching institutions in tower hamlets at which more than  pupils were said to be at serious risk since then the school has failed two inspections in october  the inspectorate found the curriculum was too narrow the assessment framework was not systematic or effective across all subjects and students did not develop a broad knowledge of cultures and faiths other than their own inspectors were returning to ascertain whether or not the school had been implementing an action plan to correct the problems however the report said the concern is that during a very brief tour of the library inspectors found three books that undermine the active promotion of the rule of british law and respect for other people the books promote inequality of women and punishments including stoning to death which are illegal in britain and which do not reflect the schools ethos of tolerance and integration staff have not been sufficiently vigilant about the availability of inappropriate texts in the library or sufficiently aware of the potential for unwittingly promoting extreme views the library had been locked since july  the report insists but students had previously had access to the books during meetings for which the space was used more recently in response a school spokesman told the mail online our position in respect to extremism is very clear we condemn all forms of extremism unequivocally and this is recognised by ofsted we recognise the concerns raised by ofsted in respect of three books in the library however as ofsted rightly noted the library is locked and current students have no access to it ofsted also recognised that the content of these books do not reflect the schools ethos of tolerance and integration nevertheless we are taking steps and are at present auditing all materials in the library and those available within the school please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

these women that were coming out and all of the stuff that my lawyers investigators had dug up with other women that said the same thing plus him actually doing it actually in the white house while he was the sitting president with monica lewinsky why would hillary not want to say im going to get to the bottom of this and these women deserve to be heard and im gonna listen to every one of these women and im gonna make a decision after i hear everything that they have to say and at that point in time i will make a decision but she never has come to any of these women to see if her husband did what he did to them and you know she dont want to because she knows its true but why wouldnt she do that if she was a woman whos as out there oh to support all women and all women have a right to be heard and she has the nerve to run for the presidency of the united states and run for all women and to be for all women what about us woman that her husband has abused in some way or another she has not tried at all to go and get to the bottom of it and just see heck we may all be lying you know what im saying she dont want to go see if we are even lying she dont even give an opportunity to talk to us women to see because if she did she knows the truth would come out and it would destroy her political career on may   when clinton was governor of arkansas and jones was a state employee she says she was singled out that day by clinton and was escorted to the politicians room in the excelsior hotel in little rock arkansas there the future president allegedly groped and exposed himself to her she says she rejected his advances and bolted the room aaron kleins most recent interview with jones can be heard here he asked me to kiss it in an interview that aired on kleins sunday night talk

her but jones said clinton also implicitly threatened her to remain silent about the events listen to part  of kleins january interview with jones jones described what she says transpired after she and clinton engaged in some small talk when she says he proceeded real casually to lean up against the chair and coming up toward me he complimented her on her long hair and i thought oh wow this was already happening  she continued what do i do here do i get out what do i do so i walked over to the windowsill and i was looking out to the river because we were right about near the river and i thought you know i need to talk to him get a distraction here and i was looking right over the river and i was talking about that and he came over there and he proceeded to make faces at me then he started doing it again and he pulled me kind of towards him and told me things and then he started kind of groping me and then i pulled away immediately and i walked toward the door i didnt know what i was going to do i just knew that i needed to get out of the situation i started talking about everything and anything to get the attention of off what was going on so i did that then he got a little closer to the door couches and we were talking about maybe political stuff or whatever because we had nothing in common nothing we could possibly talk about and the next thing you know he pulls down his pants he sat on the couch and he was fondling himself and he asked me to kiss it umm he asked you to kiss it said klein so what did you do listen to part  of kleins january interview with jones jones recounted i jumped up because i was leaning like on the side of the couch arm with his arm on it i was kind of leaning up against that and i jumped over and said no im not that kind of a girl and i need to be leaving immediately so of course he was embarrassed he turned red he pulled his pants up and i went up to the door and was trying to get out and he momentarily put his hand on the door so i couldnt completely get it opened and he said youre smart lets keep this between ourselves asked whether she took clintons alleged remark as a threat jones answered yeah yeah he said dont tell nobody well of course he didnt want nobody to know jones said the room was protected by a state trooper and that when she exited the state trooper had a smirk on his face the lawsuit jones brought against clinton almost brought down the president according to the daily mail the paper recounts the tumultuous court saga it wasnt until two years after the incident in  when former clinton bodyguards spoke in a magazine interview about escorting a woman called paula to his room in may  that she was advised to go public she hired a lawyer and in  sued clinton and asked for  in damages claiming she suffered emotional trauma clinton denied the claims or even that he had met jones he dismissed her as an opportunist out for money and to damage him politically he asked that the civil suit be put off until he left the white house but in january  an appeals court ruled the trial should go ahead while working on the paula jones investigation independent prosecutor kenneth starr uncovered clintons alleged affair with white house intern monica lewinsky it was the presidents original statement to lawyers for jones that almost led to his downfall  he denied any improper relationship with lewinsky which was found to be untrue having been accused of perjury charges were drawn up and impeachment proceedings begun although democratic leaders preferred to censure the president congress began the impeachment process against clinton in december  a divided house of representatives impeached him on december  and the issue then passed to the senate where after a five week trial he was acquitted clinton survived the political fallout what became known as the lewinsky affair his marriage to hillary also survived by the time lewinsky was headline news jones had already reached an out of court settlement with the president listen to part  of kleins january interview with jones liar hillary owes me an apology during the same january interview jones also sounded off about hillary clinton demanding that hillary personally apologize for allowing her husband to abuse and sexually harass women jones slammed hillary as a two faced liar who waged a war on women by trying to discredit predator bills sexual accusers and how dare her you know what she dont care nothing about women because if she did she would believe what i had to say she would believe what the other women had to say its really a sad sad day if hillary becomes president because she has allowed her husband to get by with this type of stuff said jones why does he have a right to be back in the white house the peoples house why is he allowed to be back there with the track record that he has and his wife and the lying that she does and how she tried to discredit all of these women that her husband abused and sexually harassed jones slammed hillary as such a liar and shes so two faced i never once was contacted by her not one time did she apologize about what her husband did to me you have the right to be heard clinton said in the video which she addressed to every survivor of sexual assault adding you have the right to be believed were with you a furious jones said clinton needs to support all of us and she needs to believe all of us if she says she believes women that claim sexual harassment have a right to be heard you know i wasnt i didnt have a right to be heard obviously i had to be scrutinized in the media and i knew that i had god on my side he knew what happened in the room bill clinton knew what happened and he was never going to admit to it the state trooper he knew just a little bit of what happened that was outside the door you know double standard on clinton cosby its like they are indestructible jones said of the clintons there are so many people i think in the media and so many people out there protecting them for whatever reason i dont know if they are scared of them or what if bill cosby  i mean even if what he did was somewhat different he still abused these women sexually and so did bill clinton im not going to speak for all of them but i know about me and what i heard about kathleen willey and different ones i mean he is a predator i just dont understand how he can get by with it war on women in november juanita broaddrick the woman who famously accused bill clinton of rape and spoke out against hillarys candidacy was a guest on kleins show i think she has always known everything about him said broaddrick i think they have this evil pact between the two of them that they each know what the other does and they overlook it and go right on and cover one for the other she said kathleen willey was a democratic activist who along with her husband ed founded virginians for clinton which supported bill clintons successful  white house bid since hillarys campaign announcement in april willey has repeatedly appeared on kleins show to speak out against the democratic front runner willey refuses to watch as hillarys campaign accuses republican candidates like donald trump of waging a so called war on women in august willey announced the launch of a new anti hillary website called a scandal a day a section of the site asks women who may have been sexually assaulted by bill clinton to come forward gennifer flowers who says she was bill clintons consensual mistress for more than  years told klein she fears a hillary clinton presidency in her only interview since clinton announced her candidacy flowers accused hillary in october of being an enabler that has encouraged him bill to go out and do whatever he does with women clinton admitted in a deposition to one sexual encounter with flowers comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s

the number of illegal migrants crossing into greece has surged by  percent compared to the same period last year with the turkish land border under increasing pressure migrants had turned first to italy and now spain as their preferred entry point to the european union after the bloc began paying the turkish government billions of euros to curb the number of sea crossings to greece following a massive influx in  but arrivals are now increasing dramatically as people smugglers exploit the greco turkish land border marked by the river evros  which is not covered by the eu deal  with  total arrivals recorded by july th according to gerald tatzgern of austrias federal criminal police office bka this represents an increase of  percent on the same period in   and may significantly underestimate the true scale of the influx as illegal migration is by definition poorly recorded with the dutch government indicating that two thirds of the migrants reaching them have not been registered in another eu country beforehand the turks are not completely ignoring the issue as they have been accused of in the past however with the ansamed news agency reporting that they have apprehended some  would be migrants in just the last week return of the migrant crisis greece overwhelmed as illegals surge across turkish land border httpstcoqspfrqpe  breitbart london breitbartlondon april   tatzgern suggested that while the migrant crisis has been partly contained on the greek front this could all change depending on the situation in turkey  for example if the economy crashes and migrants cannot find any work legitimate or otherwise then there are hundreds of thousands of migrants on the streets of turkey who would probably be pushing for europe he said warning that there is no relaxation in sight in terms of pressure on the continents borders indeed the recently quiescent balkan route for illegal immigration appears to be heating up again with the international red cross noting that the number of migrants arriving in bosnia herzegovina has increased eightfold compared to  this would appear to lend weight to hungarian prime minister viktor orbns warning that the migrant crisis is not going away but that europe is seeing seeing signs of a new migration wave of a rising tide following a low tide its rising now and this poses a challenge

will be no vote on his nomination through the end of  with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky citing the biden rule ie that nominations should not happen in a lame duck presidential election year garland  is a graduate of harvard law school and is currently chief judge on the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit where he has served since  the position of chief judge is a seven year position that goes to the longest serving member of a court under the age of seventy he formerly was a law clerk to justice william brennan perhaps the most liberal justice in the  year history of the supreme court sign up for our newsletter i hope the presidents nomination of an exceptionally qualified nominee will convince republicans to change course doyourjob  senator harry reid senatorreid march   but republicans have already said that there will be no action on any supreme court nominee until after the election in a statement wednesday morning mcconnell cited bidens now infamous  position against supreme court nominations in president george hw bushs final year in office as well as similar positions taken by outgoing minority leader harry reid d nv and his likely successor sen charles schumer d ny senatemajldr mcconnell comments on supreme court nomination here httpstcolvnozlmmqfscotusnominee pictwittercomwmxpoyun  sen mcconnell press mcconnellpress march   speaker of the house paul ryan r wi also opposed confirming garland although the house does not vote on judicial appointments under the constitution the president has every right to make this nomination and the senate has every right not to confirm a nominee  paul ryan speakerryan march   the countrys stark political divisions are the primary reason cited for avoiding a nomination fight in  voters gave the white house to one political party in  but gave the other party control of the senate in  the two parties have radically different philosophies of what a supreme court justice should do republicans believe that the constitution should be interpreted according to the original public meaning of its words while democrats believe that the constitution is an evolving document that judges should be able to re interpret according to modern political trends and beliefs this divide would dictate the fate of dozens of major issues including free speech abortion religious liberty gun rights racial preferences and government power republicans have thus concluded that the american people need to debate this issue through the year and inform washington dc of which way they want the court to go through their votes in november both for the white house and the senate consequently senate judiciary chairman chuck grassley has already vowed not to move forward on any nomination and all republican members of the committee informed senate majority leader mitch mcconnell that they would not be holding any hearings or votes mcconnell applauded that position and said the senate will not vote on any nomination until the next president is sworn in not only that but republicans argue that obama is singularly unfit to demand a vote on his nominee because as a senator he tried to filibuster the nomination of justice samuel alito attempting to forever deny a senate vote on what everyone acknowledged was an extremely well qualified republican nominee before obama had even finished his speech nominating garland the judicial crisis network jcn put out talking points of why voters should conclude that garland must not be allowed to take scalias seat jcn put out a memorandum detailing what jcn calls garlands liberal positions on a number of major issues including opposition to the second amendment and granting vast powers to the environmental protection agency epa the presidents insistence from the rose garden today that his nominee must be confirmed rapidly so he can help with the work of the courts current term cannot be reconciled with the calendar the last argument of this years annual term will be april  the average length of a modern supreme court confirmation is  days which would mean garland would not be confirmed not until late may no additional cases will be heard until october just weeks before the presidential election obama concluded his speech by saying that tomorrow garland should start meeting with senators but not a single senator from the majority party has indicated that he would be willing to meet with the nominee until after the election instead immediately after obamas speech mcconnell spoke on the senate floor quoting a  speech from joseph biden where then judiciary committee chairman biden said the senate should not hold supreme court confirmation hearings during a presidential election year this has now been labeled the biden rule its about a principle not a person mcconnell concluded and said he would look forward to considering a nominee after the next president is sworn in on january   ken

sign up for our newsletter the most prominent advocacy group for orthodox radical islam in the united states threatened to have a breitbart reporter arrested if he did not leave its soon to start public press conference about the bloody pulse massacre of at least  gay americans by an american muslim breitbart had gone to cairs pulse press conference to ask what steps islamic groups are taking to distance american muslims from orthodox islamic scripture which frequently and clearly urge the expulsion humiliation and the murder of homosexuals the press conference was to be held friday at  pm by the council for american islamic relations at their capitol hill headquarters cair has been declared a terrorist organization by the united arab emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted co conspirator in a hamas funding operation but before the event began cair spokesman ibrahim hooper told the breitbart reporter to leave when the breitbart reporter asked for an explanation hooper told an aide to call the police we have a person in our building that we asked to leave and theyre not leaving the deputy said into his phone breitbart respects property rights and left without bother the ejection is not a surprise this is the second time this reporter has been kept out of a cair press conference and the second time he has been told to leave cairs headquarters breitbart has frequently noted that the cair group is so closely entwined with islamists and with jihadis that court documents and news reports show that at least five of its people  either board members employees or former employees  have been jailed or repatriated for various financial and terror related offenses breitbart has also published evidence highlighted by critics showing that cair was named an unindicted co conspirator in a texas based criminal effort to deliver  million to the jew hating hamas jihad group that cair was founded with  from hamas and that the fbi bans top level meetings with cair officials the fbi policy restricting a formal relationship with cair remains  but does not preclude communication regarding investigative activity or allegations of civil rights violations said an oct  email from fbi spokesman christopher allen in  a federal judge concluded that the government has produced ample evidence to establish the associations of cair with hamas the pulse massacre garishly highlighted islams routine contempt for no muslim groups  and tore open a  hole in the democrats effort to expand their ideologically incoherent alliance of elite progressives insistently libertarian gays and clannish muslim leadership groups in february for example president barack obama conducted some progressive outreach to muslims groups by visiting an orthodox mosque in baltimore where he met with a islamic preacher who says status for gays is incompatible with islam while progressives demand that the state should impose sweeping changes on civic society to forcefully raise the social status of gays and even of children who claim to be transgender islam simply demands contempt punishment and even death towards anyone who engages in gay sex for example orthodox muslims believe the koran is a perfect transcription of a divine and unchangeable book of commandments from allah in verse  of book  for example allah declares that for ye practise your lusts on men in preference to women  ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds  in sodom and gomorrah we rained down on them a shower of brimstone then see what was the end of those who indulged in sin and crime orthodox muslims also say the reputed founder of islam muhammad was perfect and should be emulated by all muslims his statements are written up as the hadiths where he is shown as urging the death of homosexuals for example a collection of sayings by abu dawud records one tale narrated by abdullah ibn abbas  the prophet peace be upon him said if you find anyone doing as lots people did kill the one who does it and the one to whom it is done heres a debate between a gay muslim and an orthodox islamic cleric in contrast catholics officially abhor homosexuality as a waste of god given potential but also postpone divine judgement to the hereafter because of their  year old doctrine separating church and state on earth the church seeks to enable every person to live out the universal call to holiness persons with a homosexual inclination ought to receive every aid and encouragement to embrace this call personally and fully this will unavoidably involve much struggle and self mastery for following jesus always means following the way of the cross says the catholic church on sunday after the massacre of  gays by a muslim  also a registered democrat  the political groups that claim to lead muslims in america rushed into action for example the top religious organization for muslims living in the united states the fiqh council of north america issued a press release condemning the massacre the press release which was titled religious extremism tried to minimize the role of islam the fiqh council of north america issues unqualified condemnation of the barbaric acts of orlando shooter who senselessly killed and injured scores of innocent people the heinous crimes of this mentally unstable person are absolutely against the teachings and values of islam the holy quran equates killing of one innocent soul with the killing of all humanity there is no justification whatsoever in the quran for violence against any group regardless of religion color creed or sexual orientation almighty god has dignified all human beings due to their common origin regardless of their religious ethnic or sexual orientation but a press release has no standing under islamic law traditionalist muslims know that this is intended to deceive unbelievers and they dont take it seriously said robert spencer an expert on islam who runs the jihadwatch website traditionalist muslims know that the claim that there is no justification whatsoever in the quran for violence against any group regardless of religion color creed or sexual orientation is absolutely risible and contradicted by numerous quran verses including      etc spencer said in a statement to breitbart news but if the fiqh council did write a fatwa recognizing the equal status of gays it would be denounced as engaging in bida  innovation  and threatened by other muslims  because if muhammad said x and a muslim says not x now then yes the punishment is death spencer said on sunday night the fiqh councils website did not provide an email address for further inquiries in contrast the muslim public affairs committee  which seems to have close ties to obamas deputies  actually referred to the reality that the  dead were mostly gays and lesbians although it did also claim that islam endorses at least some categories of civil rights mpac and many other american muslim groups around the country have strong ties with lgbtq communities and groups and have worked together to oppose hate intolerance and bullying which impacts both of our communities as we all grapple with this senseless tragedy and we learn more about the motives and facts of the case we will be reaching out to lgbtq communities with condolences and solidarity as president obama said at his press conference this afternoon let us stand together in our grief and outrage and our solidarity with the victims and their families as muslims we believe in religious freedom civil rights and human rights we reject violence hatred and discrimination toward anyone on the basis of race gender disability religion sexual orientation or national origin we support civil rights for all people may god guide us all as we strive in his cause the miami herald printed a vague quote free report on the cair press conference at  pm shortly after the breitbart reporter was ejected american muslim leaders are condemning the attack on a gay nightclub in orlando that killed  people and wounded more than  others nihad awad the executive director of the council on american islamic relations called the killings a hate crime and said the group has no tolerance for extremism of any kind a law enforcement official has said the gunman omar mateen called  from the nightclub and expressed allegiance to an islamic state leader awad says members of the lgbt community have stood with muslims in the past and today they stand that community awad has a long history of pro hamas statements according to critics cair has posted its

days after castiles shooting reuters reported that yanez lawyer said this incident had nothing to do with the race of the driver he added it had everything to do with the presence of a gun castile

sunday on cbs face the nation while commenting on the recent police shootings in louisiana and minnesota and a sniper targeting and killing five dallas police officers former new york city mayor rudy giuliani r said african americans must teach your children to be respectful to the police and youve got to teach your children that the real danger to them is not the police the real danger to them  out of  times  out of  times are other black kids who are going to kill them transcript as follows john dickerson welcome back to face the nation with us now is former new york city mayor rudy giuliani mr mayor i want to ask you about something former speaker newt gingrich said which is that he said white americans cant understand the extra risk that comes with being black in america and that whites instinctively underestimate the danger of the black experience what do you think about that giuliani i agree with that completely i agree largely with the sentiments of congressman elijah cummings d md the reality is we have to look differently at race in america if were going to change this weve been looking at it the same way for  years and heres where we are and we both have to try to understand each other first let me say my deep sympathy for the people of minnesota the people of louisiana the people of texas and of dallas and id like them all to remember that although these incidents happened in different ways they all share it together as americans and we share this violence together as americans so maybe whites have to look at it differently and blacks have to look at it differently whites have to realize that african american men have a fear  and boys have a fear of being confronted by the police because of some of these incidents some people may consider it rational some people may consider it irrational but its a reality it exists and theres a second reality in the black community and the second reality in the black community is theres too much violence in the black community so a black will die  percent or less at the hands of the police and  percent of the hands of a civilian most often another black so if you want to protect black lives then youve got to protect black lives not just against police which happens rarely although with tremendous attention and which happens every  hours in chicago every  hours and we never hear from black lives matter dickerson well then  giuliani so if you want to deal with this on the black side youve got to teach your children to be respectful to the police and youve got to teach your children that the real danger to them is not the police the real danger to them  out of  times  out of  times are other black kids who are going to kill them thats the way theyre going to die dickerson so mr mayor  giuliani now on the white side we have to understand that whether we get it or not there is this extraordinary fear of the police and police have to be  have to institute a policy of zero tolerance like we did for crime in new york zero tolerance no disrespect way back  year ago commissioner howard safir began a program in new york city called courtesy professionalism and respect it was continued by the next three police commissioners including the one just had on now dickerson mr mayor let me just ask you you started out by saying that white americans have to understand that this is happening in the black community and then at the end you said members of the black community have to teach their children to behave in front of the police that  those messages seem to conflict with one another giuliani of course they dont if i were a black father and i was concerned about the safety of my child really concerned about it and not in a politically activist sense i would say be very respectful of the police most of them are good some can be very bad and just be very careful dickerson and so what do police  giuliani id also say be very careful of those kids in the neighborhood and dont get involved with them because son theres a  percent chance theyre going to kill you not the police and weve got to hear that from the black community and what weve got to hear from the black community is how and what they are doing among themselves about the crime problem in the black community when there are  shootings in chicago over the th of july and  murders and black lives matter is nonexistent and then theres one police murder of very questionable circumstances and we hear from black lives matter we wonder do black lives matter or only the very few black lives that are killed by white policeman  dickerson mr mayor  giuliani but not all those black lives that are killed by other blacks dickerson do you  giuliani and on the black side what they hear from us is constantly defending the police now ill give you an example i had a police officer who brutally attacked a gentlemen named amadou diallo that police officer is now sitting in jail for  years due to the work of my police commissioner howard safir and the prosecution of now attorney general loretta lynch i also had police officers who were wrongly accused and acquitted by a jury even though mobs were calling for them to be put in jail despite the fact that a jury found them not guilty dickerson mr  giuliani so these are complicated situations and we have to try to understand each other dickerson right the  just a final question sir you said that the black lives matter movement has put a target on the back of police officers when members of the african american community see videos as they have this week they feel like there is a target on young black men explain your response about how theyve put a target on police officers how that can match up when people see these videos giuliani well when they talk about killing police officers dickerson but they dont  giuliani when they sing  well they sure do they sing rap songs about killing police officers and they talk about killing police officers and they yell it out at their rallies and the police officers hear it dickerson but mr mayor what you seem to be doing is taking  giuliani and the reality is  please please let me finish and when you say black lives matter thats inherently racist dickerson well i think their argument would  giuliani black lives matter white lives matter asian lives matter hispanic lives matter thats anti american and its racist dickerson well  giuliani of course black lives matter and they matter greatly but when you focus in on one percent of less than  percent of the murder thats going on in america and you make it a national thing and all of you in the media make it much bigger than the black kid whos getting killed in chicago every  hours you create a disproportion dickerson all right giuliani the police understand it and it puts a target on their back every cop in america will tell you that if you ask him dickerson all right mayor giuliani thanks so much for being with us giuliani thank

people can be charged with an offence if their actions are within the law but their reasons for doing it are perceived as illegal hate by others london police have said before withdrawing the claim social media users began drawing attention to the metropolitan forces new and highly unusual definition of a hate crime on the th of this month it remained like that until the th according to google cache before the police edited it again on monday the definition did not match that given by the college of policing or crown prosecution service and critics online claimed it could be read as a threat against thought crimes breitbart london asked the metropolitan police for comment on their change of heart over hate crime but no reply had been received at the time of publication londons metropolitan police inform you that you can be arrested for doing something that isnt illegal if someone else thinks you had bad thoughts while doing it joked us commentator jeff jacoby in st century britain you could be charged with a hate crime if anyone thinks your actions could have been motivated by hate added another twitter user the met seems to imply that a person can face two charges one for the assault and another for their reasons for doing it that is not true added criminal barrister matthew scott in an extensive blog post he explained that although there are some cases where doing an act is illegal irrespective of your state of mind there are no cases where your state of mind can make you guilty of an offence if you dont actually do anything capable of amounting to a crime mr scott accused the met of writing gobbledegook and argued that a badly written website misleads the public and damages the reputation of the metropolitan police occasionally legal bloggers make a tiny difference blogged this yesterday  today the metpoliceuk rewrote the hate crime section of their website httpstcookphezvv  matthew scott barristerblog march   the earlier section of the mets hate crime definition might also seem alarming insisting that people only need to believe a crime is motivated by hate for it to be recorded as such however this is a common definition used by police tracing back to recommendations of the  macpherson inquiry the crown prosecution service confirmed last year that a hate incident only needs to be perceived with no evidence needed and many uk forces include dislike and unfriendliness as evidence of a hate crime the mets confusion about the definition of a hate crime comes after they were successfully sued earlier this month and forced to pay out  for falsely accusing a man of hate on twitter and harassing him and his family the official twitter account of the metropolitan police lgbt network accused a man of an undercurrent of homophobia racism and just general nastiness and appeared to threaten his family members in  as breitbart london reported at the time exclusive londons lgbt police are harassing non pc twitter users naming family members in tweets httpstcoioldwlwct  raheem raheemkassam august   please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
today theresa may will head for buckingham palace to become the uks new prime minister i have to say that the choice of a remainer and her selection on the grounds of party unity is not particularly to my liking that feeling is shared by many conservative party members a fact that is proven by significant numbers of them joining ukip in the past twenty four hours so the real question is what happens next and will the views of seventeen and a half million people count the good news is that mrs may has said brexit means brexit indeed i am confident that we will get back our parliamentary and judicial sovereignty it is important that article  is triggered shortly after the summer recess i dont think mr juncker will be spending much time in his office during the month of august whilst there are problems with article  it is the statement of intent that is important my real worry is not whether we regain control of our laws but on what terms we separate already i hear the weasel word access to the single market being used this establishment line is that to have full access to the single market corporate cartel we have to have the free movement of people my mep colleague and ukip trade spokesman william dartmouth points out that last year the eu bought  trillion euros worth of goods from countries with whom there is no pre condition of free movement whatsoever i will be watching closely to make sure this government is not blackmailed by brussels it is time for strong leadership and real vision for our country unmentioned since the referendum is the key issue of our territorial waters and the fish stocks that swim within them i tried my best to make this a referendum issue by helping to organise the flotilla of boats that came up the thames i will never forget sir bob geldof flicking v signs and worse from his gin palace boat stuffed full of establishment millionaires it is going to take real courage to take back what is rightfully ours in fisheries terms we want to be like norway iceland and the faroes we want our own exclusive  mile zone already in brussels there is blind panic meetings have taken place over the last two days and other governments will fight hard to keep catching as many of our fish as they possibly can we have a battle on our hands a positive suggestion that i would like to make is that the roles of agriculture and fisheries should be decoupled though ive never been a supporter of big government the reclamation of our fisheries which done correctly would be worth several billion pounds a year should be a cabinet position with its own department as the  general election approaches the ultimate brexit test will be to see if our harbours are active with newly commissioned vessels and people coming back into what was a great industry before we were conned into joining the common market if those harbours are quiet and the industry still depressed the wishes of voters on june rd will have been betrayed if that is the case just watch ukip in the  general election nigel farage is the outgoing leader of the uk independence party please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
the president of the european council has published an open letter to european leaders explaining why the european union should ignore british prime minister theresa mays request for a brexit extension to june and give a full year instead the letter from the top eurocrat comes as theresa may spends tuesday in talks with the french president and german chancellor in their respective capital cities ahead of wednesdays special meeting of european union leaders in brussels house of lords and the queen rubber stamp law stopping no deal brexit httpstcoiqlrpxvn  breitbart london breitbartlondon april   after failing to sell her brexit deal to parliament may has gone back on her previous promises to take britain out of the european union on march th  with or without a deal and is now seeking a second extension to push the official withdrawal date into the future while the prime minister appears to prefer a series of short extensions top eurocrat tusk appears to reject this approach insisting on one long extension instead remarking that there are times when you need to give time time tusk wrote tuesday of mays request to extend to june th our experience so far as well as the deep divisions within the house of commons give us little reason to believe that the ratification process can be completed by the end of june in reality granting such an extension would increase the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits creating new cliff edge dates this in turn would almost certainly overshadow the business of the eu in the months ahead tories face election backlash if they fail to deliver brexit httpstcondyifod  breitbart london breitbartlondon april   tusks reference to brexit holding up other european business and other remarks later in his letter referring to ways to sideline this reflect apparent serious concerns by frances macron who sees the continued failure of the brexit process as overshadowing his attempts to reform europe a political analysis published by londons times newspaper tuesday reports that the overly technocratic messaging coming from a european totally consumed by the brexit process means the union risks appearing to voters even more out of touch than it is now the paper reported mr macron is already said to be fed up with european summits devoted to brexit rather than to his own plans for eu reform for this reason and a host of others the french president is now said to be considering blocking theresa mays request for any further extension to get past the distraction of brexit from his grand project but going by recent european political history characterised by fudges and compromise suggests this is unlikely despite brexit referendum and endless promises uk govt lays legal groundwork to host eu elections httpstcomecszogiwq  breitbart london breitbartlondon april   the british prime minister has now finished meeting with president macron and spoke with angela merkel this morning a government spokesman said of business so far the prime minister met with president macron in paris this afternoon ahead of the eu council meeting tomorrow following the prime ministers letter to donald tusk last week the leaders discussed the uks request for an extension of article  to  june with the option to bring this forward if a deal is ratified earlier the prime minister updated president macron on the ongoing talks with the labour party to agree a way forward that respects the result of the  referendum they also discussed upcoming european parliamentary elections with the pm saying that the government was working very hard to avoid the need for the uk to take part the leaders also discussed the ongoing situation in libya the pm expressed her deep concern about the recent escalation and said it was important for the international community to work together to bring an end to the violence a draft european union report seen by british journalist faisal islam lays out the requirements the european union expects of the united kingdom in return for any further delay among them are participating in the may  european union elections which the uk government has already put in place preparations for and not reopening negotiations on the withdrawal deal theresa may was given by the eu further to those the paper also demands the united kingdom acts in a constructive and responsible manner in accordance with the duty of sincere cooperation the requirement comes after senior british brexiteers threatened to be as difficult as possible towards europe if britain was forced to stay inside the union against its own will suggestions by jacob rees mogg and nigel farage included vetoing the eu budget obstructing the eu army and causing trouble in the european parliament mrs may goes to meet the boss httpstcowfezomr  nigel farage nigelfarage april   the latest to join that fight is tory brexiteer and rising star mark francois who delivered a message to european leaders tuesday afternoon when he said at an event hosted by the bruges group if you now try to hold us in against our will you will be facing perfidious albion on speed it would therefore be much better for all our sakes if we were to pursue our separate destinies in a spirit of mutual respect this is the st century and you cannot hold a nation captive against their will if you attempt to hold us in the european union against our will we will become a trojan horse within the eu threatening a new conservative government led by a brexiteer like boris johnson or dominic raab mr francois said a united kingdom trapped in the eu would seek to make a nuisance of itself by blocking future attempts at federalising the union and creating a single military  which the uk has historically done

chinas systematic crackdown on religion under president xi jinping is the worst in  years according to a report published thursday in its nationwide move to rein in religious practice china has persecuted its uighur muslim population in xinjiang but is also targeting tibetan buddhists christians jews and those who follow chinas folk religions with greater government scrutiny now than it has in several decades writes beijing based ben halder for the international media company ozy officially atheist since the communists took power in  china is now taking harsher measures against religion than at any time since the end of the s cultural revolution  when books associated with religion and spiritualism including confucian thought were burnt in public halder writes as the us commission on international religious freedom uscirf noted in its annual report for  chinas new regulations on religious affairs which came into effect in february last year introduced a virtual ban on unauthorized religious teachings and requires religious organizations to report any online activity to authorities halder says this crackdown has taken many forms last april beijing ordered the removal of bibles and other christian books from online bookstores and e commerce platforms across china presumably to introduce a new state approved translation of the sacred christian text that will conform to chinese socialist ideology at the time china announced that one of its major tasks in the coming years is to enhance chinese style christianity by reinterpreting and retranslating the bible according to halder for a while especially in the s and s china tried to portray itself as less repressive against religion at a time it was seeking to integrate itself in global governance bodies such as the world trade organization under president xi jinping however the communist party has targeted all organized opposition  including student unions and young communist groups critical of the party and religion is at the forefront of this battle religious groups especially if theyre growing represent a challenge to that hegemony halder notes the new regulations on religious affairs has paved the way for china to sinicize religious thought in a campaign that attempts not only to diminish and erase the independent practice of religion but also the cultural and linguistic heritage of religious and ethnic communities uscirf said in its report at the chinese communist party cpc congress held in october  the head of the umbrella agency that oversees religion insisted that socialist core values must be at the core of any religious faith active in china zhang yijiong the leader of the united front work department ufwd said that the communist party had a long way to go to sinicize religion which means preventing anyone from taking advantage of religion to harm national security and endangering national unity rather than outlaw it outright therefore china has sought to domesticate christianity so that it serves to support rather than oppose the values and structures of chinese communism a prime example of this is the chinese catholic patriotic association ccpa chinas state run catholic institution and the official alternative to the illegal underground catholic church faithful to rome in its seemingly desperate attempt to restore open diplomatic relations with beijing the vatican under pope francis has distanced itself from the underground church and ceded some authority in the naming of bishops to the communist party chinese president xi jinping harbors a particular animosity toward christians and sees underground churches as a severe national security threat according to the founder of china aid a us based watchdog group china aid founder and president bob fu told a conference on religious persecution in april that the number of persecuted christians has dramatically increased under the reign of president xi jinping who has animosity against christianity in particular the number of people we documented who are persecuted among just christians alone last year reached  compared to these  in  mr fu said whereas underground churches that operate outside state control are seen as a particular threat growing attendance even at official churches has provoked hostility from the xi government and the state has forced churches to install facial recognition systems to identify those attending services every church building was forced to put a sign banning children students civil servants military personnel and communist party members from entering mr fu said follow tdwilliamsrome please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

if youre looking for a shortcut to get your kid into a prestigious college but your little one doesnt have high enough cheekbones to claim to be an indian consider the petal strewn path of the newly elected san francisco district attorney chesa boudin chesas sparkling credentials are he is the son of celebrated cop killers kathy boudin and david gilbert that was enough to win him admission to yale oxford and yale law school his mother consciously parlayed her way to success by becoming a violent revolutionary after realizing that she wasnt going to set the world on fire with her sat and lsat scores poor kathy couldnt get into oberlin  and then she couldnt get into yale law she was terrified of losing her place as her father leonard boudins most cherished offspring as susan braudy put it in her book family circle the boudins and the aristocracy of the left all this is covered in lascivious detail in my book demonic how the liberal mob is endangering america by contrast kathys brother michael  the republican  had nearly perfect board scores graduated magna cum laude from harvard college went on to harvard law school worked for a white shoe law firm then took a top position in the reagan administration today he is a federal appeals court judge appointed by the first president bush the only thing kathy could do to impress her father  and our nations elite institutions  was to become a domestic terrorist it worked her parents showily displayed kathys motorcycle helmet from her participation in the days of rage in chicago jean boudins pride in her aristocratic position on the left braudy writes made her the match of any palm beach hostess in addition to the days of rage which left a democratic politician paralyzed kathy was part of the weather underground brain trust that blew up a greenwich village townhouse in  killing three of the radicals the bomb they were building was intended to kill servicemen and their dates at a fort dix dance with body parts flying and walls collapsing around her kathy made it out of the house one step ahead of the police again kathys parents were delighted with the townhouse bombing her mother had always envied the owners for their wealth anyway her father thought seeing his daughter on fbi wanted posters was good for his legend as luck would have it going underground after the townhouse explosion finally gave kathy an excuse to get a nose job she also dyed her hair bright red mimicking bernadine dohrn born bernadine ohrnstein these revolutionaries would engage in sex orgies to smash monogamy but one convention the gritty radicals adhered to was the wasp ideal of beauty and gentrified names the only thing that terrified kathy braudy says was that if stripped of her glamorous and dramatic revolutionary attachments and subterfuges she would be the dullest person in leonards circle of admirers  she would be a woman no longer young whose work was waiting tables and cleaning houses in fact thats exactly what she was while kathy and david play acted being on the run the fbi wasnt even looking for them anymore a newspaper in wisconsin published david gilberts whereabouts and  oh my gosh  nothing happened no one arrested him braudy writes the authorities werent interested in him it was time for drastic action those lsat scores werent going to bury themselves so in  kathy conspired with violent drug addicted members of the black liberation army to rob a brinks armored truck in rockland county new york they wanted drug money and she wanted fame at the nanuet mall her bla co conspirators murdered brinks guard peter paige and wounded two others then hopped in the getaway truck being driven by kathy and david the truck was stopped by the police minutes later but  year old kathy emerged from the trucks cab playing an innocent housewife frightened by all the guns she begged the perplexed police to lower their weapons no sooner were their firearms holstered than six bla members leapt out guns blazing they instantly killed the forces only black officer waverly brown sergeant edward ogrady died a few hours later on the operating table shed done it kathy was a bona fide success in jail she received a string of celebrity visitors and fawning journalists there would be documentaries glorious write ups oscar nominations and poetry awards after decades of recounting her sufferings since the robbery that left brown dead kathy was told that browns son still attended the memorial service held for his father and sgt ogrady at  pm every oct  really kathy said i never knew the guy had a son according to our betters thats an idealist she was granted parole in   supported by none other than william f buckley the elites circle the wagons soon she was a professor at columbia university and director of the schools center for justice these status obsessed yale rejects became radicals in order to win a lifetime of good press and cushy academic positions unavailable to them any other way look at david hogg rejected from a half dozen non elite schools only to be accepted by harvard  all for raising his scrawny little arm in a preposterous one arm salute after a speech denouncing the national rifle association true hoggs sat score  was far below that of the average harvard student  it was even below that of recruited athletes at harvard  but he had turned himself into a left wing activist just in the nick of time harvard here i come the two idealists who raised chesa boudin were william ayers and bernadine dohrn on account of putting a bomb in the pentagon ayers became a distinguished professor of education and senior university scholar at the university of illinois at chicago for praising the manson family and leading a group of protesters in a little ditty that mocked the government official paralyzed during the days of rage rampage dohrn was made a professor at northwestern university school of law another leftist celebrity susan rosenberg had conspired to kill cops blow up buildings and rob a brinks truck she was sentenced to  years in prison for felony murder and possession of more than  pounds of explosives she was pardoned by president bill clinton on his last day in office a couple years later rosenberg was offered a teaching position at hamilton college apart from her fondness for bombs and cop killing rosenbergs credentials consisted of a masters degree in writing from a correspondence course in prison oh by the way when kathy boudin was finally arrested after the brinks robbery the police searching her morningside drive apartment found amid the food stamps and welfare forms kathys application to new york university law school its one thing to say a person shouldnt be punished for the sins of his

i worked with donald trumps team before he announced for the presidency on opposing the trans pacific partnership a policy decision which put me at odds with many of my conservative friends but defending the united states of america against a trade deal which would eviscerate our national sovereignty was worth the cost today i find myself in opposition to president trump on a pair of foundational issues  the right to keep and bear arms and due process which both are under attack through so called red flag laws the sad reality is that history demonstrates that these types of well meaning laws are too easily abused i do not make this choice lightly recently after returning from a meeting at the white house i had lunch with a friend a fellow patron of the restaurant overheard that i had been in the meeting and heard me say favorable things about the president after which this unknown person approached my table and started screaming invective at me even as his two young boys pleaded with and pulled on dad trying to get him to leave this self proclaimed georgetown law grad continued his screaming rant as spittle flew from his foaming mouth along the way he expressed the opinion that i and everyone like me should die along with other lovely bits of wisdom online and media crazies declaring all supporters of donald trump to be nazis can be discounted as a legitimate threat to the safety of those of us who have historically supported the president but when someone who ostensibly is well educated and part of the legal system completely loses it simply because of the existence of a donald trump supporter in his midst that is a red flag another red flag is the abuse of the fisa court by politically motivated high ranking fbi officials who launched a three year witch hunt of donald trump using unverified and salacious opposition research with the help of a complicit media in an attempt to initially influence and then overturn the results of the  election if the president of the united states is not safe from politically motivated abuse of the prosecutorial system how can the average citizen trust that a law allowing legal temporary confiscation of firearms using expedited due process wont be abused by every risk averse and politically motivated prosecutor in america almost thirty years ago when i was the state lobbyist for the national rifle association handling new jersey i saw and fought against law enforcements abuse of that states gun laws i remember the woman in her twenties who was not allowed to purchase a handgun by local law enforcement for five years until she won a court decision  all because she made the mistake of calling a suicide hotline one time when she was  and her parents were going through a divorce that single call was viewed as a red flag and an excuse to deny her a handgun permit and today i see democrat presidential candidate after democrat presidential candidate promising to ban and confiscate guns and i see president donald trump supporting a red flag law which will lay the groundwork for them to do it in a world where supporting donald trump is a red flag for the left it is both politically and from a policy perspective disastrous for president trump to support any red flag confiscation measure no matter the purported expedited due process safeguard in new york city a maga hat wearing gallery owner was beaten for simply wearing the hat in miami a black man wearing a maga hat at the cheesecake factory was surrounded and threatened by restaurant employees trump administration officials have repeatedly been harassed and denied service at restaurants and democratic officials have encouraged this behavior the obvious truth is that the left has has so demonized anyone who supports donald trump that no legal ground can be ceded to give these loons of the left a lawful pathway to confiscate guns no amount of due process protection will matter to those who believe that all trump supporters are nazis and hence all trump supporters are evil and should be stripped of their rights unfortunately we dont have to speculate about the inevitable outcome of red flag laws as fifteen states have adopted them including maryland where i reside last november in the county just north of my residence police decided to execute a red flag warrant at  am and the predictable result was that the subject of the warrant ended up dead from a police bullet the dead gun owner was unavailable to contest the police version of the shooting red flag laws are designed to confiscate a persons legally held property under the presumption that they may misuse that property in the future and given that the accusation itself is that the accused has the possibility of doing violence to themselves or others even the most well intentioned prosecutor and law enforcement agents will err on the side of denying the rights of the accused due to the fear that the accusation may prove correct  and failure to aggressively enforce the law will be devastating to their personal careers regardless of the credibility of the complaint the accused is then required to prove that the accusation is wrong with those sitting in judgment facing enormous political pressure to leave confiscation orders in place destroying the presumption of innocence whats more in todays internet age the accused forever will be tainted by the accusation regardless of outcome america witnessed this type of reputational assassination by accusation recently and it is shocking that gop politicians who witnessed the wild accusations levied against justice brett kavanaugh are at all open to the idea that a federal gun confiscation law should be put in place that has at best only a fig leaf of due process protection and for this trump supporter the continuing push by this president in support of gun confiscation language serves as perhaps the biggest red flag of all rick manning is the president of americans for limited government please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

sign up for our newsletter house speaker paul ryan used president barack obamas final state of the union speech to trash donald trumps popular pro american immigration platform  and to call for a radical wage cutting open borders plan the hit was delivered via the gop response speech presented by south carolina governor nikki haley her speech  which was almost certainly approved by ryan  dumped on trump and touts ryans preference for a any willing worker economy sign up for our newsletter that any willing worker term is used to describe nationwide employment rules which would allow any employer to hire any willing foreign workers if american workers decline to take the jobs because the offered wages are too low president george w bush worked with gop leaders to push those rules in  and  but saw his poll ratings crash and his plans defeated in december ryan inserted stealth language in the  omnibus bill that allows us employers to hire roughly  low wage foreign blue collar workers  dubbed h b guest workers  in  to take the place of american blue collar workers the key willing worker phrase is buried in the middle of the haley speech just after a passage that hits at trumps supposedly angriest voices i am the proud daughter of indian immigrants who reminded my brothers my sister and me every day how blessed we were to live in this country haley said in her response speech my story is really not much different from millions of other americans immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is americatoday we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory during anxious times it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices she said suggesting that trump is an irrational angry person who dislikes foreigners then came the hidden call for an any willing worker labor policy we must resist that temptation no one who is willing to work hard abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country she said that phrase  no one who is willing to work hard should ever feel unwelcome in this country  is very different from trumps pro american speeches trumps immigration reform plans call for actual enforcement of immigration laws which now limit employment in the united states to people born in the country or to people legally admitted as immigrants or as guest workers for example trump has proposed to reform the h b program which imports foreign university graduates for jobs sought by american college grads his reform would rase the minimum wage for the h b workers so that companies would import only the most productive foreign workers not ordinary foreign college grads to take jobs sought by americans in practice trumps emphasis on blocking illegal immigration and curbing guest worker programs will gradually boost wages for americans and increase high tech investment that helps explain why those plans are so popular  and why trump has shoved aside ryans allies  such as gov jeb bush and sen marco rubio  in the  primary race if ever implemented ryans any willing worker plans would allow employers to hire an unlimited number of foreign college grads for wages far below current wages paid to american college grads that global competition for us white collar jobs would crash middle class wages and force americans to vote for democratic politicians in the hope of getting taxpayer funded benefits or government imposed minimum wages since  obama has encouraged the inflow of legal and illegal foreign workers into the us economy in  for example he used the laws to add  million foreign workers to the economy just as  million young americans began looking for work wages stalled but profits rose and the stock market spiked that year haleys speech tried to downplay the impact of the any willing working theme by adding some vague reassurances that the border wont be open to anyone who wants to take jobs or commit jihad attacks no one who is willing to work hard abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country at the same time that does not mean we just flat out open our borders we cant do that we cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally and in this age of terrorism we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined but her speech immediately refocused on the gops hope of importing more workers because it portrayed immigration problems as only a problem of uncontrolled or illegal immigration  not a problem caused by the legal and controlled inflow of a massive wave of company hired wage cutting foreign legal willing workers we must fix our broken immigration system she said that means stopping illegal immigration and it means welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

new british prime minister boris johnson said it was the mission and purpose of his government to make the united kingdom the greatest place to raise a family in his first address to parliament as leader but courted the displeasure of small c conservatives by again talking up an illegal migrant amnesty speaking in parliament the prime minister hit similar themes to those he already expressed wednesday night outside downing street as he took on the office of prime minister promising to deliver brexit and to work on law and order in particular he confirmed his pledge to put  more police officers on the streets but mr johnson also articulated the feeling clearly held by many in britain that the country had been put into a state of managed decline he told parliament over the past few years too many people in this country feel they have been told repeatedly and relentlessly what they cannot do since i was a child i remember respectable authorities asserting that our time as a nation has passed that we should be content with mediocrity and managed decline i believe in this pivotal moment in our national story we are going to prove the doubters wrong again brexit in  days no ifs no buts boris johnson makes first speech as uk prime minister httpstcoqgdxwxktl  breitbart london breitbartlondon july   mr johnson promised a coming golden age for the country when he continued the greatest place to bring up a family the greatest place to send your kids to school the greatest place to set up a business that is the mission of the cabinet i have appointed and that is the purpose of the government i am leading and that is why i believe that if we bend our sinews to the task now there is every chance that in  we will be able to look back on this extraordinary period as the beginning of a new golden age for our united kingdom while the mainstream media has been fast to label mr johnson as a british trump and his own insistence that he was going to make britain great again may have aped his united states counterpart mr johnsons own record has shown him up to be far more liberal of the president and often deeply critical of trump one area where this is particularly clear is johnsons long held views on an amnesty for illegal migrants his pledge to deliver one of those while mayor of london was raised in parliament thursday afternoon by labour mp rupa huq who asked him whether he would stand by his previous views rather than deflect or delay as is normal for british politicians mr johnson approached the topic enthusiastically and said the governments standing commitment to deport illegals was nothing more than theoretical difficult and something that needed looking at delingpole to succeed boris just needs to ask himself  what wouldn t theresa do  httpstcoyqhyboocu  breitbart london breitbartlondon july   mr johnson told the chamber i do think that our arrangements with theoretically being committed to the expulsion of perhaps half a million people who dont have the correct papers and who may have been living and working here for many years without being involved in any criminal activity at all i think that legal position is anomalous and we saw the difficulties that kind of problem occasioned in the windrush fiasco i do think we need to look at our arrangements for people who have lived and worked here for a long time unable to enter the economy unable to participate properly or pay taxes without documents the truth is the law already allows them an effective amnesty but we should look at the economic advantages and disadvantages of his pledge for an amnesty for illegal immigrants breitbart london reported this week on mr johnsons pro amnesty proclamations when he said that illegals in london had earned amnesty in  that he wanted an amnesty so illegals could pay taxes in  and when he called for amnesty for over one million illegals during the brexit campaign it has been conservative party policy for the last three general elections to control migration to the united kingdom and as part of that reduce net inflows to under  a year that target has not been met please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

the  year old son of a south korean fisheries ministry official that went missing last month  who seoul accused north korea of killing at sea  wrote a letter to leftist president moon jae in published tuesday condemning him for not doing enough to protect his father the mans identity has remained anonymous except for the detail that he worked for the ministry of oceans and fisheries west sea fisheries management service and was  years old the victims brother has identified himself publicly as lee rae jin the job required many hours at sea and close to the north korean border but south korean officials have not yet offered a clear explanation for how the man went missing or reportedly ended up in north korean waters the south korean defense ministry accused north korean soldiers of shooting the official to death while he was swimming in the water then burning his body immediately after his death no evidence the man was armed or posed any threat to the soldiers exists nor does any concrete explanation for why he was in the water south korean news outlets have speculated he was trying to defect to the north but no clear motivation for doing so has surfaced north korea found the man in its waters and committed an act of brutality by shooting at him and burning his body according to our militarys thorough analysis of diverse intelligence south koreas defense ministry said in a press release at the time adding that the man is presumed to have jumped into the sea monday in a suspected attempt to defect to the north south korean news outlets have accused the south korean military of watching the officials death from its side of the maritime border but failing to act to protect the man for fear of violating north koreas sovereignty and triggering more violence the north korean communist regime denied that it burned the mans body instead pyongyang insists that it did shoot the man because he was illegally crossing the border but never found his body and burned his bloody clothes as chinese coronavirus pandemic protocols demand americas top military official in korea confirmed last month that pyongyang has issued shoot to kill orders on its borders to prevent outsiders from bringing the chinese coronavirus into the country north korea claims it has documented zero coronavirus cases since the pandemic began a number most global medical experts question the officials son notes in his letter published in the pages of conservative south korean newspaper chosun ilbo that the official also had an eight year old daughter his sister he asks moon what was the government doing while my father was brutally killed if your children or grandchildren were in my place would you still behave as you do now the son asked i wonder what attempts the government made while my father was slaughtered and why he couldnt be rescued the unnamed son insisted the family had no reason to believe his father was planning an escape to north korea and expressed disgust at the speculation regarding that theory fueled largely by a coast guard report when he went missing suddenly stories that have not been proven appear as hot topics in the media every day how can someone drag the breadwinner of a family through the mud the son wrote adding that the official called us on the phone as usual and even made a video call to my sister saying that he would come home in a few days before the news of his death surfaced the son also speculated that his father never jumped into the water arguing that the man could not swim and was too small to successfully navigate the rough korean waters he also suggested the fact that north korean officials knew his identity and other basic details imply they captured and interrogated him before potentially tossing him in the water and killing him i want to ask if it really makes sense for a skinny man who weighs only  kg at a height of  cm to swim deliberately against the tide he wrote please rehabilitate my dishonored father so that my mother younger sister and i can have normal lives the teen concluded in a plea to moon moon jae ins foreign policy has been defined by his insistence that kindness and diplomacy towards the communist north even as the korean war approaches  years of age would lead to breakthroughs in the pursuit of peace hopes placed on moons policies after several in person meetings with dictator kim jong un were violently dashed this summer after the kim regime ordered the bombing of a joint liaison office on its side of the border used for daily check ins with the south following its accusations against the north seoul revealed that dictator kim jong un had allegedly issued an apology for the incident claiming he said he was immensely sorry the united nations later disputed the south korean governments claims kim jong un expressed regret for the incident which is an important gesture but it wasnt an apology because actually he also declared that the guards didnt infringe instructions and regulations when shooting the individual un special rapporteur on north korea toms ojea quintana told voice of america in late september moon publicly responded to the victims sons letter on tuesday saying my heart is also aching i understand the pain of a son who lost his father moon said in a statement relayed by a presidential spokesperson adding however that he would not comment on the details of the case before the completion of the coast guards more thorough investigation following preliminary findings the spokesman also promised that moon would respond to the boy in a private letter in tandem with the publication of the letter the boys uncle lee rae jin held a press conference tuesday in front of the united nations human rights office in south koreas capital urging international intervention to ensure the fairness and accuracy of any south korean government investigation into the incident we hope this incident serves as a foundation in preventing similar incidents in the future lee said the brother also demanded access to audio the south korean military reported possesses of a conversation the fisheries official had with north korean troops before his death to confirm the veracity of any investigative conclusions speaking to the south korean newspaper joongang ilbo lee insisted the mans family had no reason to believe he wanted to move to north korea my younger brother was just an ordinary public servant with a strong sense of duty he said my nephew could not go to school after media reported the government conclusion that he was defecting to the north my heart broke when i read my nephews letter a family attorney kim ki yun reportedly explained that the data will verify if he really expressed his desire to defect and if he expressed his real intention the information will also reveal if the ministry worked properly to save his life and allow the bereaved family to see the last moment of

sign up for our newsletter president donald trumps firing of a politically motivated officialnow former acting attorney general sally yates for her refusal to enforce the laws of the nation and carry out the administrations policyharkens back to a previous president who faced a similar crisis at the beginning of his administration cnn has been framing this in its lower third chyron throughout the evening as the monday night massacrea reference to president richard nixons firing of both his attorney general and deputy attorney general when they refused to get rid of a special prosecutor who was investigating himwith the intent to paint trump as an off the rails tyrant but even watergate journalist carl bernstein appearing on cnn late monday night rejected the comparison his own network cnn was making to the nixon administrations saturday night massacre theres a big difference because the saturday night massacre was really about firing the attorney general when nixon was the target of an investigation and was actively obstructing justice bernstein said i think the president is within his rights here to fire the attorney general that he has that ability the reference that is much more accurate in this case is a reference to a different previous gop president an outsider battling to gain control of the federal government in his early days in office former white house political director jeffrey lord who served under president ronald reagan told breitbart news that this matches reagans battles with the bureaucracy at the beginning of his administration i remember vividly when president reagan fired the air traffic controllersthe patco union which had endorsed him as a candidatein  lord said in an email all of washington was saying this was a mistake he did it anyway totally violating the washington political and media elite conventional wisdom of the day kudos to president trump for doing the st century version of reagans bold firing to uphold principle elites will hate it but americans will love it more to the point they will get it back when president reagan first took office in the spring of  while he was still recovering from the failed assassination attempt by john hinckley his transportation secretary drew lewis informed him that the professional air traffic controllers organization patco planned to strike the wall street journals peggy noonan wrote about the pivotal moment years later the unions  workers manned radar centers and air traffic control towers across the country these were tough high stakes highly demanding federal jobs the unions contact was up they had been working under increasingly difficult conditions and they wanted a big pay increase lewis told me reagan was sympathetic the increased pressures of the job justified a pay increase and he offered an  jumpthis within a context of his budget cutting but patco demanded a  increase this would cost taxpayers an estimated  million reagan rejected it outright he told lewis to tell the union that he would not accept an illegal strike nor would he negotiate a contract while a strike was on he instructed lewis to tell the head of the union robert poli something else as a former union president he was the best friend theyve ever had in the white house patco was one of the few unions that backed reagan in the  presidential election in which the then newly seated president beat incumbent president jimmy carter in a shocking landslide win and reagan wasas noonan wrotesomeone who considered himself a union man and didnt want to be seen as a republican union buster noonan wrote still reagan believed no president could or should tolerate an illegal strike by federal employees especially those providing a vital government service not only was there a law against such strikes each member of patco had signed a sworn affidavit agreeing not to strike talks resumed fell apart and by the summer  of the air controllers walked out they had thought reagan was bluffing he wouldnt fire them they thought because it would endanger the economy and inconvenience hundreds of thousands of passengersand for another reason which well get to in a moment then when the walkout happened she wrote that it became a crisis so naturally reagana conservative with backbonedid what he said he would do he refused to accept the strike and refused to resume negotiations she wrote he called reporters to the rose garden and read from a handwritten statement hed composed the night before if the strikers did not return to work within  hours they would be firedand not rehired the  hours was meant as a cooling off period in the meantime reagan made clear nonstriking controllers and supervisory personnel would keep the skies open after a political catastrophe played itself out in the media on the world stage reagan won he broke the strike by firing the more than  striking air traffic controllers and worked feverishly to replace them after banning them from federal service for life bill clinton later lifted the ban and more importantly he regained control president reagan showed he was in control of the federal bureaucracy the millions strong federal workforce that generally votes for democrats not republicans and that the government was under his command it was a defining moment fast forward to early  and president trump is less than two weeks into his administration after defeating democrat hillary rodham clinton in a shocker landslide electoral college victorywhere he won  electoral votes from  and a half statesstunning the media the political class and the federal bureaucracy to ascend to the highest office in the land as an aside clintons failure to win even  full states was an embarrassmentespecially since basically everyone in the political cultural and financial elite universe thought she would succeed nonetheless it was mostly smooth sailing for president trump for his first week in office occasional media blowups from the usual anti trump suspects and scarce political opposition helped the newly inaugurated president of the united states make it through his first seven days in office easily but on the seventh day this past friday president trump signed an executive order restricting immigration from seven terror prone countries and putting a temporary pause on the refugee program and over the weekend into early this week all hell broke loose the media lost control trumps political opponents in both parties unleashed fierce criticism of the president his policy and the rollout process while the media fanned the flames then on monday evening the storyline hit critical mass sally yates the acting attorney general of the united states issued a directive to justice department employees that they should not enforce the presidents new executive order yates a political appointee from trumps predecessor democratic president barack obama in the role of deputy attorney general had agreed to stay on to help the peaceful transition of power to the trump administration after the election she was named until her successor is confirmed as the acting attorney general that means she agreed to follow the laws of the united states and execute the policies of the president of the united stateseven ones with which she disagreed politically the question she faced is whether trumps order was legally defensible trumps team ran the order through the department of justices office of legal counsel they determined it was legal therefore yates duty was to enforce the laws of the united statesand uphold the constitutionas directed by the president of the united states something she knew when she accepted the position to help with the peaceful transition of power sen jeff sessions r al the incoming attorney general is likely to be confirmed by the senate judiciary committee on tuesday and by the full us senate later this week that means yates decision to break her oath to uphold the laws and constitution of the united states and the policies of the president comes just days before she was going to lose her temporary appointment anyway but it also presented a critical moment for president trump let career government bureaucrats and politically motivated ex obama officials who are serving in similar capacities throughout the administrationsources with direct knowledge of transition efforts tell breitbart news there are approximately  such politically appointed ex obama officials still serving in key governmental positions as the transition continuesrun over him and cause him to lose control or show the millions strong governmental workforce regardless of any particular government workers ideology who is the boss trump chose the latter and in true trumpian fashion treated america and the world to his signature catchphrase from the apprentice reality television show youre fired trump canned yates almost instantly then he brought in a new acting attorney general dana boentethe us attorney for the eastern district of virginiato enforce the laws of the nation the press release from the white house was strong ripping yates for her betrayal of the department of justice and for being weak on immigration and national security the trump white house said the acting attorney general sally yates has betrayed the department of justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the united states this order was approved as to form and legality by the department of justice office of legal counsel ms yates is an obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration it is time to get serious about protecting our country calling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme it is reasonable and necessary to protect our country tonight president trump relieved ms yates of her duties and subsequently named dana boente us attorney for the eastern district of virginia to serve as acting attorney general until senator jeff sessions is finally confirmed by the senate where he is being wrongly held up by democrat senators for strictly political reasons the statement then quoted boente as saying he intends to uphold the laws of the country and faithfully execute the office of the attorney general while he is acting in that positionsomething yates for political purposes refused to do i am honored to serve president trump in this role until senator sessions is confirmed i will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected boente identified after the quote as acting attorney general of the united states of america said the white house is playing this bold move in which president trump retook control and showed the government whos in charge cool for now the president acted to protect the country and its citizens sean spicer white house press secretary told breitbart news late monday evening but outside allies and top trump supporters are ecstatic rick manning the president of americans for limited government told breitbart news donald trump demonstrated today that he refuses to allow a politically motivated obama appointee who fell into the role of acting attorney general due to the intransigence of democrats in the senate to overturn the will of the people the immediate replacement of this remnant of obamas open borders policy was both warranted and necessary america is fortunate to have a decisive leader in the white house who is determined to not allow those who lost the election to dictate how he will govern president trump is to be commended for upholding the rule of law in firing yates for her politicization of the justice department judicial watch president tom fitton added in an emailed statement to breitbart news while the political class and media are ripping trump and his administration over this for now this may provewhen the history books are writtento be one of the most decisive moments in his presidency and while there are certainly questions as to whetherdespite the widespread popularity of trumps actionthe rollout of his executive order was done effectively yates betrayal and trumps quick seizure of the moment could be the pivot point that turns the tide of the narrative back in his direction after a rough past few days for now

cities across the country are lining up for a standoff with president donald trump over the issue of sanctuary city policies republican representatives in congress are also lining up to put more teeth in existing law that already requires  percent cooperation with immigration authorities by local and state law enforcement agencies border patrol agents are reported to be on pace to apprehend nearly  migrants crossing our border illegally a recent report released this week by us customs and border protection revealed the number of apprehensions of what the border patrol calls family unit aliens fmua during the month of december rose for the sixth month in a row  up  percent in the first three months of this year compared to last theyre mobilizing because they dont know what tomorrow will bring but know today they can cross border patrol agent chris cabrera told fox news while acting in his capacity in the national border patrol council one of the big draws for some of these families who risk their lives to come here from central america is the knowledge that if they get here they will likely not be sent home fox news william la jeunesse reported in sanctuary cities even if they commit a crime officials will ignore federal immigration detainers that would remove them from the country and simply set them free one of these mayors los angeles mayor eric garcetti went even further  creating the la justice fund to provide millions of dollars in legal assistance to immigrants facing deportation the reason it was important for us to act is we will have a change in government next month he told la jeunesse we expect there could be actions right away he is likely to be correct these mayors sheriffs and state leaders are thumbing their noses at federal immigration law representative lou barletta r pa told breitbart texas on thursday the only way to stop them is to hit them in their pocketbooks he introduced a bill earlier this month to do exactly that barletta said his bill the mobilizing against sanctuary cities act hr  attached below strengthens the current law  usc   being used to strip law enforcement grants from sanctuary jurisdictions my bill will enhance this by stripping all federal fundsnot one cent representative john culberson r tx worked with the doj throughout  to force the department to certify the top ten sanctuary jurisdictions and use this existing law to cut off their funds for grants awarded in  but this law only effects law enforcement grants the president can cut off their money at noon on january   if they do not change their sanctuary policy and hand over criminal illegal aliens in their custody to be deported culberson told fox news barlettas bill the mobilizing against sanctuary cities act hr  awaits a hearing in the house judiciary committee chaired by rep bob goodlate r va before it can move to the house floor for a vote barletta concluded to me theres no gray area hereright is right wrong is wrong and illegal is illegal more cities have been rushing to get on the sanctuary city bandwagon since president trump was elected in november many appear to feel emboldened by the actions of other cities that were not met with repercussions when i originally introduced this bill in my first session there were  cities that were considered sanctuary cities the third term congressman said now that number has grown to more than  because we didnt do anything about it when there were only  were putting the american people in danger other bills have also been introduced to attack sanctuary and force them into compliance with existing immigration law representative andy harris r md introduced the federal immigration law compliance act of  filca in december with co sponsors from california to new york to florida the representatives website states breitbart texas reported earlier in january the bill would require any entity including institutions of higher learning to comply with all lawful requests made by us immigration and customs enforcement ice requests the bill requires the withholding of all federal funding to any entity that refuses to comply with federal immigration enforcement requests congress has the responsibility to protect the rule of law in our country and provide for the safety of our citizens we need to focus on protecting american citizens and those who are in this country legally instead of providing shelter for those who have violated our immigration law and entered this country illegally if any entity refuses to comply with federal immigration law they should be denied federal money until they come into compliance congressman harris said in a written statement obtained by breitbart texas representative duncan hunter r ca also introduced a bill to deal with the growing sanctuary campuses promising to shut out immigration officials the no funding for sanctuary campuses act was introduced in late december to define sanctuary campus and create financial penalties for any institutions of higher education that violates immigration laws the bill hr  was co sponsored by representatives tom mcclintock r ca and lou barletta r pa if a school wants federal money an open declaration that its a sanctuary should disqualify it for federal support hunter told the washington examiner in an interview its free to do that of course but there should be a consequence in the form of withheld federal funding  its that simple hunters and harris bills were introduced in the closing days of the last session of congress it is likely they will be reintroduced

the british government knows so little about religion that they think conservative evangelical christians are as bad as islamist extremists the archbishop of canterbury has said the church of englands most senior bishop said government officials often dismiss christians as a bit bonkers if they hold traditional views and called on ministers to learn more about religious belief addressing a conference of church of england head teachers justin welby said our government generally is desperately trying to catch up to understand a world in which they have no grip on what it is to be religious at all where religious illiteracy is prevalent and extremely destructive of understanding and where they cant see really the difference between an extremist muslim group like the muslim brotherhood and a sort of conservative evangelical group in a church of england church the telegraph also quotes him as saying its fine to reject and condemn many of the things done in the name of religion but you still need to understand what it is that can so catch hold of someone that they think life itself is not worth living if that contradicts what they believe the archbishop recounted one meeting he had with a very senior politician who accused anglican bishops of failing to support the governments so called british values agenda because they refused to say their religious beliefs were less important than the rule of law he said look at our british values what have you got against the rule of law as a british value i mean are you seriously going to tell me that i dont call someone an extremist if they say that their faith is more important than the rule of law the archbishop said so i took a deep breath and said well youve got a real problem here because for me personally my faith is more important than the rule of law so youve got an extremist sitting in here with you the british governments efforts to promote british values in schools have been frustrated partially because few agree on what they actually are one document drawn up by the department for education last year was slammed as vacuous and ideologically driven by christian groups after it failed to mention christianity as key british value instead highlighting secular festivals such as burns night may day and even the notting hill carnival andrea williams of christian concern said we should celebrate the freedoms and amazing advances that christianity has brought to britain airbrushing christianity out doesnt prepare children for life in modern britain it deceives them please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

the government of taiwan revealed on monday that the democratic country had attempted to donate  protective medical suits to the communist party of china in february as wuhan coronavirus cases were rising exponentially in the country but beijing refused them the communist party rejects taiwans status as a sovereign state insisting it is a province of china taiwan operates full independently of beijing and has never been ruled from beijing in its history as china is an extremely wealthy and influential dictatorship however it has successfully limited taiwans diplomatic ties to other states and international organizations taiwan maintains diplomatic ties with only  states and cannot participate in the united nations or currently more pressingly the world health organization who due to communist party bullying taiwan mainland affairs council minister chen ming tong confirmed reports on monday that despite the tense relationship between taipei and beijing the taiwanese government attempted to send  sets of protective medical suits to china to protect health workers caring for patients infected with the highly contagious virus the suits would have reportedly gone to hubei province whose capital is wuhan where the virus originated taiwan news reports that hubei declined the offer citing chen saying that the communist party officials claimed the lead time is too short to deal with focus taiwan another local media outlet blamed chinas eastern airlines for rejecting the suits eastern airlines flew  taiwanese citizens home out of wuhan in early february upon landing in taipei the taiwanese government reportedly said it wanted to fill the plane with protective gear before it flew back eastern airlines declined the airline is majority owned by the communist party focus taiwan notes that the eastern airlines rejection came after the rejection from hubei itself neither side has reportedly brought up the potential donation since despite multiple reports that the wuhan coronavirus outbreak in china continues to pose significant challenges to the communist partys poorly administrated healthcare system beijing currently alleges that the outbreak within its borders has concluded reopening key parts of the city of wuhan the rejection of humanitarian aid from taiwan apparently occurred shortly before china announced that it would stop counting mild coronavirus cases towards its official tally even including individuals who had tested positive for carrying the virus in their system chinese officials never clarified how to distinguish a mild confirmed coronavirus case from a severe one a significant question given many reports of hospitals beginning to reject anyone who appeared to have coronavirus infection symptoms chinas irregular way of counting coronavirus cases may have resulted in an official death count over ten times smaller than the real number of people who died multiple outlets reported on monday the communist party signaling the reopening of hubei province allowed people in wuhan to collect the ashes of the dead for the first time this weekend reports from wuhans seven funeral homes suggest between  and  people died in the past three months significantly more than the about  deaths the government claims occurred as a result of the wuhan virus these march numbers correspond to estimates attempted by the epoch times in february using interviews with anonymous funeral directors in wuhan who said they were creating four to five times the number of bodies they typically see on a daily basis in contrast to china  which if the numbers using urn tallies this week are correct is far and away the deadliest country to be diagnosed with coronavirus in  taiwan has largely contained its internal outbreak taiwan has the luxury of being an island but as it has close proximity to china was also at high risk of an epidemic taiwanese officials used public health infrastructure designed during the  sars outbreak and a hearty distrust of the communist party to begin targeting and isolating individuals who might be carrying the virus early taiwan also limited travel to and from china and began taking safety precautions long before china confirmed the existence of the new virus in late january scientists have traced the first wuhan coronavirus case back to november  despite its success in containing the virus taiwan is still not a member of the who and protested yet again on monday that the who has not shared pivotal medical data with the country as it has claimed to the who claims that since it falsely considers taiwan a province of china all the information it provides to the communist party trickles down to taipei it also lumps taiwans coronavirus cases into the official tally of the peoples republic of china therefore saddling taipei with the tens of thousands of cases that beijing is responsible for the who has largely responded dismissively or furtively to demands from journalists for clarity on its status with taiwan on saturday who doctor bruce aylward repeatedly pretended he could not hear a question about taiwan blaming allegedly poor reception via videolink then ignored the question entirely later when the call was reconnected the presenter asked him to comment on taiwans progress in containing the virus aylward replied that all areas of china have done well and wished hong kong luck in its efforts canadas national post noted last week the taiwanese government revealed that it had notified the who early of evidence of a viral outbreak spiraling out of control in china but the who rejected taiwans warning taiwan did report our concern on the severity of coronavirus last december to the who taiwans representative office in washington told

sunday on cbss face the nation sen jon tester d mt said president donald trump wants to use the american taxpayer like an atm machine to pay for a wall on the us mexico border partial transcript as follows brennan your colleague senator shelby said negotiations are at an impasse and they need to find out what democrats want and when as the democrat here what can you explain tester well first of all margaret i would just say that you know we passed a bill a couple of year  couple of weeks ago to keep  keep the government open and the house refused to take it up i think that the fact were at a government shutdown is nothing short of ridiculous i think that senator shelby and  and others are  are spot on we need to sit down and  and pound out a deal i think that that agreement that the  the senate passed  in a bipartisan way a couple weeks ago would have give us the opportunity to come to an agreement the problem is is  is that the president has one point three billion dollars from last year for  for border security actually  billion for border security one point three for the wall that he has spent very very little of that brennan he says needs more tester yeah and he says yet he needs more yet theres no plan to go where the money how the money is going to be spent or any analysis on whats most effective to secure the border bottom line is margaret is that i dont talk to anybody in the senate that doesnt want secure borders its just how the money is going to be spent and if the president wants to continue to take a campaign promise that he made which was to have mexico pay for a wall and say no the rules have changed now were still going to build a wall but were going to have the american taxpayer pay for it were going to use the american taxpayer like an atm machine thats not the right direction to go brennan the white house says its democrats who walked away from the table you heard senator shelby say there there was an offer that he put forward of two and a half billion this year two and a half billion next year what happened to that tester well i think that  that that deal never got passed leadership but  but what did happen this last year is the president asked for one point six billion dollars in his budget proposal for this next year the appropriations committee which senator shelby chairs and senator leahy is a ranking member of agreed to that in a bipartisan way senator shelby voted for it senator mcconnell voted for it the president moved the goalposts and said no now i want five billion brennan well and theyve come down to around two why cant democrats come up from one point three tester well i think that thats negotiations that need to be done between leadership between senator shelby senator leahy and others and move forth but the big thing is is that how is the money going to be spent whats the most effective way to secure that southern border and thats really whats important here i think we can do it with technology and manpower and much more effectively than  than with a wall brennan you heard senator shelby say there that he thinks probably youre going to have to talk about things that democrats have said they wanted including protections for dreamers is that the kind of sweetener that would get democrats to reconsider tester well i think weve been here before i was  i was in the room when the president said if  if congress passes that im going to sign it and then he moved back away from that and so i think ultimately in the end we do need comprehensive immigration reform theres no doubt about that margaret but  but in the end we need to know what the president wants and hopefully hell stick to it when we passed the bipartisan funding to go to the first of february a couple weeks ago the president said he was gonna sign it and then after we passed it he said he wasnt going to sign it we need some predictability brennan the president said of those two migrant children whove died in us custody that its democrats fault essentially hes arguing that theres incentives that are in us law that encourage people to cross and take this really dangerous migration route how do you respond to that tester well i respond to the fact that we need comprehensive immigration reform that needs to be there for a while i think its everybodys fault this is unacceptable and  and the bottom line is is that if were able to get comprehensive immigration reform done which is going to require some brennan thats a big ask tester senate leadership and leadership in the white house too then i think that we will see things settle down in the southern border in a big big way brennan is there a cost for democrats to appear to work with the president tester no i think what democrats need to do is they need to work for the country and make sure that not only the southern border but the northern border is secure make sure that we have the ability on the borders to be able to screen every vehicle coming across to make sure that drugs dont come into this country and i think that if were able to get a plan to be able to do that which i dont think is that hard to do i think democrats and republicans can work together to  to make sure that we have a secure border and  and keep this country safe follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with

on tuesday the fbi determined that an alleged noose found in the garage stall of nascars only black driver bubba wallace had been in the garage stall since at least october  and nascar said in a statement that the noose was actually a garage door pull despite the findings determining the alleged noose was part of the garage stall msnbcs al sharpton continued to question the findings sharpton highlighted wednesday on morning joe that both the fbi and nascar continued to refer to what was found in the stall as a noose he also suggested someone assigned wallace who the msnbc host referred to as a victim and possible target the garage with a noose and said he does not think the investigation is closed the fbi identified it as a noose nascar said it was a noose or went along with the fbis characterization it was a noose sharpton emphasized so the question is even if they did not know that bubba wallace was going to use that stall why was a noose in the stall its clear what a noose represents and i think to go whether or not they knew that sooner or later the one black driver would use that stall really doesnt answer why it was in the stall at all and then did someone know that it was in the stall when they did belatedly assign bubba there so i dont think this answers a lot of questions and clearly from what we just saw of bubba wallace it does not seem he who is the victim and possible target in this matter seems to be satisfied with this so i do not think that weve seen closure in this particular inquiry follow trent baker on twitter magnifitrent please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
kellyanne conway senior adviser to donald trump campaign chairman paul manafort joined breitbart news daily siriusxm host stephen k bannon to discuss the  campaign including how things currently stand in ohio conway pointed out that trump sees this as a national political movement and thats very important to him in that he would like to compete in places where romney completely cratered there are states like iowa colorado that romney lost by more than six points in wisconsin he lost by almost seven points the new york times nyt recently came out with a piece that looks like more than a bit of water carrying for hillary clinton donald trump finds himself playing catch up in all important ohio despite all its hype however even nyt was forced to acknowledge the race for ohio is all but tied given that three percent is well within the margin of error of most any poll public polling of ohio which has been scant shows hillary clinton with an average lead of about three percentage points the nyt piece was a bit disingenuous is this regard said conway it made the claim that donald trump is behind in ohio and it relied on one poll where theres a two and a half point difference which as you know is very competitive as well as within the margin of error he added i believe trump will spend time there i think hillary clintons comment in west virginia that she will quote put the coal industry out of business reverberates westward from west virginia right through the midwest right through the rust belt states like ohio pennsylvania indiana michigan possibly iowa and wisconsin so hell have a lot to say once he gets there as for ohio conway also said given the amount of time and money clinton has already spent in ohio and the polling that tells you shes the one with the ceiling and that her floor and ceiling are dangerously close together breitbart news daily airs on siriusxm patriot  weekdays from  am to  am eastern comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page
mainstream media outlets have been blasted for peddling total nonsense today as left wing newspapers coalesced to claim with one voice that only three of the suspects involved in colognes mass migrant rape on new years eve were recent migrants or refugees but colognes prosecutor ulrich bremer has said that the claim is total nonsense after an interview with german paper die welt this weekend was misinterpreted and reported in a way that the left wing outlets wanted rather than what the truth was the huffington post the independent the metro and russia today all jumped on clumsy reporting from liberal outlets on the european continent going so far as to heavily editorialise their news copy on the issue the huffington post claimed two syrians and one iraqi had been detained by police as part of their inquiries contrary to the hysteria caused by headlines which accused hordes of refugees of masterminding the assault while the independent which recently announced it was going online only due to a slump in newspaper sales exclaimed majority of suspects are of algerian tunisian or moroccan descent and none had recently arrived in germany police have reportedly said the huffpos tweets were titled the facts behind cologne sex attacks make awkward reading for refugee bashers but police said no such thing with the associated press clarifying the statement from bremer who has clarified the overwhelming majority of persons fall into the general category of refugees the papers are thought to have made the error because they do not understand the migrant crisis  thinking that only syrians and iraqis count as migrants or refugees when an overwhelming number of algerians and moroccans had been named amongst the cologne suspects but thousands of algerians moroccans tunisians and dozens of other nationalities have arrived in europe since the migrant crisis began in earnest in early  and news outlets werent the only ones to fall for the shoddy reporting of mr bremers comments the news was seized upon by open borders campaigners broadcasters and even government agencies chief communications  spokesperson at the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr tweeted only three out of  men arrested for cologne sex attacks were refugees httpstcoiqaeopoyie  melissa fleming melissarfleming february   lbcs james obrien said what will british media do with this  arrests over cologne attacks  refugees  german  moroccanalgerian httpstcoinxisiehea  james o brien mrjamesob february   while kenneth roth of human rights watch tweeted despite all the demagoguery only  of the  cologne attackers identified were refugees httpstcocimpqs pictwittercomspzzwwppg  kenneth roth kenroth february   sunny hundal a journalism lecturer at kingston university currently being looked at by the metropolitan police for racist anti white tweets said httpstwittercomsunnyhundalstatus the huffington posts article was shared hundreds of times while the independent link was shared over  times the indys coverage also included a comment piece by algerian nabila ramdani entitled cologne sex assaults muslim rape myths fit a neo nazi agenda the piece itself would likely make no sense either way as tunisian and algerian migrants are just as likely to be muslim as iraqi or syrians ms ramdani writes for the guardian the independent londons evening standard the mirror the telegraph the daily mail the sunday times the new york times and the bbc and sky the media wide mishap comes after it took breitbart london to break the news of the mass cologne rapes and theft on new years eve for the english speaking world since then news outlets have rushed to play catch up posting fake videos and even blocking their own content in european countries please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

elections scheduled to take place on tuesday beijing has held a position on the council four times and is competing with other human rights violators for the seat the council is divided into five regions so china only has to compete with other states in the asia pacific region for the post five countries are competing for four open seats china nepal pakistan saudi arabia and uzbekistan human rights council terms last three years if elected china will join some of the worlds most repressive states on the council including libya eritrea and venezuela cuba and russia are competing to return to the council in their respective regions where there are as many candidates as seats open so they are expected to join experts believe china will manage to win one of the four open seats in its region president donald trump withdrew the united states from the human rights council in  citing its status as a safe haven for rogue regimes in  when china was last on the council it leveraged its power to silence legitimate ngos and human rights activists as human rights watch detailed that year at chinas behest the un expelled the head of the world uyghur congress from its headquarters in the un that year while he was attending a forum on indigenous issues  no explanation was provided china had successfully pressured interpol to issue a red alert  a notice urging members to arrest a person  for isa at the time in  the president of interpol former chinese official meng hongwei canceled the red alert chinese authorities abducted him a year later and sentenced him to  years in prison on dubious corruption charges prior to that human rights watch noted china disappeared a dissident for urging beijing to listen to the general public regarding the united nations universal periodic review of its human rights status after activist cao shunli became gravely ill in detention and died the chinese delegation in geneva in march  blocked a moment of silence called for by ngos at the council human rights watch noted china not only undermines the concept of human rights but also uses its influence in the un to silence any debate on its horrific human rights record isa said in a statement announcing the campaign to keep china off of the human rights council the world uyghur congress and the uyghur human rights project are leading the charge along with  other uyghur groups omer kanat the executive director of the uyghur human rights project described giving power over human rights law to china as perverse given that regimes behavior its difficult to comprehend the perverse logic behind the possibility of electing china  the government currently committing genocide against uyghurs  to the un body responsible for overseeing human rights protections around the world kanat said in a statement in a joint statement from the groups involved published by the world uyghur congress they accuse beijing of taking steps to substantially undermine a well functioning human rights system arguing that state sovereignty and non interference should be central to its mission chinas recently proposed resolutions undermine the universality and indivisibility of human rights and pose a threat to the effectiveness of un human rights mechanisms the statement read referring to the expulsion of isa from the united nations and the abuses that led to caos death the uyghur organizations join a growing list of human rights ngos and other agencies urging the world not to allow china on its international panel to protect human rights united nations watch an ngo dedicated to monitoring the policies of the world government agency published a report this week in conjunction with several other human rights groups opposing not just chinas bid for a council seat but cubas russias saudi arabias pakistans and uzbekistans all rogue states electing these dictatorships as un judges on human rights is like making a gang of arsonists into the fire brigade the executive director of united nations watch hillel neuer said in announcing the publication of the report its logically absurd and morally obscene that the un is about to elect to its top human rights body a regime that herded  million uyghurs into camps arrested crushed and disappeared those who tried to sound the alarm about the coronavirus and suffocated freedom in hong kong china is currently believed to be interning between  and  million ethnic uyghurs and other muslim ethnic minority people in concentration camps in xinjiang its westernmost province there witnesses say prisoners are forced into slavery and subject to communist indoctrination torture rape and monitored for organ harvesting while not on the human rights council china used its general assembly position this week to force the un to issue a statement in support of its concentration camps cuba presented a joint statement representing  china allies in support of the concentration camps claiming people of all ethnic

chinas state run global times expressed outrage wednesday over comparisons between its economy and brazils dismissing brazilians as lazy and insisting that it may sound racist but brazils culture is too inferior to chinas to ever succeed with full development under communist party leader xi jinping chinas government has increased calls for the embrace of traditional chinese culture meaning a mixture of han culture and maoist communism over other world cultures including minority cultures within china like uighur or tibetan culture chinese state media has increased the publication of articles arguing that han chinese people are more intelligent harder working and generally superior to others around the world the article published wednesday by global times senior editor ding gang claims that any reports suggesting that xis rule has weakened the chinese economy through repelling cooperative international exchanges with belligerent behavior and a disregard for international trade rules do not properly understand the power of the han chinese culture it uses brazil as an example of an inferior culture not worthy of joining the developed world this attitude is notably different from chinas toward brazil as recently as two years ago under socialist president dilma rousseff when xi was betting millions on brazils economy modernizing and flourishing as always occurs however rousseffs socialist policies and the widespread corruption that defined her tenure has brought brazil to the brink of collapse in part due to unmanageable debts to china current president elect jair bolsonaro has promised to distance the brazilian government from china and curb spending fueled by unwieldy chinese loans addressing them as a sovereignty issue global times editor ding does not mention bolsonaro by name instead he targets all brazilian people i stayed in brazil for three years and well understand why the brazilian economy has weakened and why chinas would be different to be honest brazil does not compare well with china ding writes his impetus for the comparison is an article by us columnist bret stephens that argues according to ding that chinas economy will fall just as brazils did under rousseff ding takes offense at the idea that brazilian culture is comparable to the han chinese my experience says whether a country can achieve industrialization depends on many factors culture being the most important it includes how people view their work family childrens education and wealth accumulation he writes it may sound racist to differentiate development based on culture but after living in brazil for a while you will find out the answer brazilians are not willing to be as diligent and hard working as the chinese neither do they value savings for the next generation like the chinese do yet they demand the same welfare and benefits as those in developed countries ding concludes this inherent laziness in the brazilians makes the country unsuitable for manufacturing in contrast chinese people have huge potential for pursuing family and personal happiness dings assertion that brazilians are doomed to failure because they are lazy and entitled does not appear to be intended to directly criticize xis policy of investing heavily in brazils economy for years but inevitably raises the question of why china would bother with such a hopeless country if dings conclusion was so impossible to escape in  the global times was touting the importance of cultural exchanges with the allegedly inferior brazilians xi has invested heavily in spending to teach chinese people the portuguese language and send them to study abroad as recently as a year ago  a year after the brazilian congress impeached and removed rousseff  experts observed that chinas deepest influence in any latin american nation was occurring in brazil foreign investment from china was flowing into brazil like a tsunami one expert noted china also invested in expanding its military relationship with brazil indicating a higher level of trust in brasilia than ding appears to have the communist party censors and screens all media in china and strictly controls what state media outlets publish leaving little room for the possibility that dings is a minority opinion in beijing the trigger for chinas change in attitude appears to have been the election of conservative bolsonaro in october as the head of government to be explicitly warned against chinese investment as a candidate suggesting that china is buying brazil and intends to control its government since then china has shifted to heavy investment in neighboring argentina while the global times has warned of a radical cultural shift making brazil suddenly unhospitable to xi jinping the times has not limited itself to criticizing brazils culture however publishing a growing number of stories asserting that chinas culture is superior to all in terms of political culture chinese civilization may not enjoy the longest history of all ancient civilizations but it has survived vicissitudes for thousands of years and still prospersthe epitome of chinese peoples vitality and creationas well as a reflection of the political culture in chinese civilization one  column read explaining that the soviet union fell because it lacked traditional chinese culture including the merging of communism with confucianism just as the russians failed where the chinese claim to succeed so too does the global times explain away americas problems as cultural ones a year ago a column in the newspaper argued that the american opioid crisis was impossible in china because the country lacks a lax cultural attitude more prevalent in the united states the article failed to mention that china is the worlds largest exporter of fentanyl an opioid responsible for about half of american opioid overdose deaths last year what drives the chinese to work so hard it is not only the pursuit of better pay domestic economy but also their mentality and the workplace culture the times boasted in september confucianism is still relevant even in asia chinese are regarded more hardworking than people of other countries laziness is regarded a crime it is said recreation will make you less determined it is almost like a religion that has deeply impacted chinese in china and overseas the newspaper asserted holding on to this idea most chinese would rather show their boss that they work for longer hours than showing they work smart or efficiently follow frances martel on facebook and

sign up for our newsletter columnist charles krauthammer said that the second fox news debate was much more substantive than about any other and that former florida governor jeb bush had a very strong night new jersey governor chris christie did well texas senator ted cruz and florida senator marco rubio had their moments but cruz had a bit of a rocky start while rubio had his rockiest night due to the questioning of his immigration record on thursdays kelly file on the fox news channel sign up for our newsletter krauthammer said there was a  it was a very spirited debate it was much more substantive than about any other and there was almost none of the ad hominems and the insults that one had heard in the earlier debates there was a lot of hard questioning and a lot of tough exchanges but it did not have anything to do i thought with the kind of personal level that wed heard before ill leave it to the viewers to figure out why he continued secondly i thought it was interestingly the best night that jeb had in all of the debates and i might even say i think he might have had the best night of the group in this debate he was very strong he had one moment where he kind of flipped back to marco rubio on the question of immigration krauthammer added that this was a kind of a reversal of that moment in one of the earlier debates when there was a tangle between rubio and bush and rubio turned it very strongly against bush krauthammer added i thought in his own way christie did well he has a way of coming in after the others are arguing and sort of rising above it and saying this is why you need a doer a governor etc when he had that line about you need a dictionary to explain washington speak into ordinary english again setting himself aside he didnt have a soaring moment but i thought he did well cruz and rubio were the most interesting because they were the ones who had the most at stake each of them had their moments cruz had a bit of rocky start when attacked you the moderators for trying to cause argument  debate between you the crowd was not very appreciative of that and rubio i thought had his rockiest night he had the good moments but i think on immigration where you showed the contradiction between what hed said a few years ago and what he said now he had a really hard time arguing his way out of that box krauthammer further said that while cruz had contradicted himself and hes not sure if his argument is better he made a better one tonight and he kind of wriggled out of it with slightly more finesse and a sense of conviction than rubio did in explaining away his contradictions he also argued that while kentucky senator rand paul didnt really change his standing in the race having him on the stage i thought was an addition krauthammer concluded i thought one of the most interesting aspects of the debate is how little people went after trump the only one who did and i thought it was a rather nicely delivered hit was by jeb when he came out against the demonization of the other particularly muslims in response to the to the video that had been shown on youtube and also i thought he made a good defense for the first time a rather forceful defense of his position on how to act in  with isis in the middle east particularly since the question had a kind of a hook on it mentioning the failures of his brothers policy in the middle east he sidestepped it and i thought he handled it very well follow ian hanchett on twitter ianhanchett comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

the office of the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction sigar a government watchdog agency revealed in a report published tuesday that american taxpayers lost about  billion to waste fraud and abuse in afghanistan in the past decade john sopko who holds the sigar title said in the report that his office had documented several outrageous instances of misspent american money in the period covering may  to december  including the construction of a soccer stadium not built to regulation  rendering it useless  later improperly used as a military training site and the construction of staircases to nowhere in single floor developments a significant percentage of the waste identified   billion  went to counter narcotics programs in the country that sopko deemed wasteful because the programs did not achieve their intended purpose the taliban jihadist group  which ran the country prior to the american invasion in the aftermath of the september   al qaeda attacks  generates a significant portion of its funding from growing poppy an opium crop used to make a variety of opiates including heroin and fentanyl according to the united nations afghanistan produced  percent of the worlds opium in  record high cultivation dipped in the face of extensive droughts  not counter narcotics efforts  but appears poised to rise as desperate farmers look for ways to survive the global economic crash caused by the chinese coronavirus pandemic the sigar report noted that this misspent money may be only a fraction of what american taxpayers have lost in the country as the agency has reviewed less than half of the  billion that congress has appropriated for afghanistan reconstruction efforts since  of the sum reviewed about  percent was lost to waste fraud and abuse including corruption and incompetence a significant majority of the documented instances of failed spending sigar identified about  percent of the  instances in the report were identified as waste defined by the government accountability office gao as the act of using or expending resources carelessly extravagantly or to no purpose these instances included programs and projects that lacked clear program goals performance measures and quality data to support management decisions as well as assets that were not used abandoned or posed safety hazards the report noted among the largest wasteful projects identified was an incorrectly constructed sports stadium in kunduz province we found that a sports stadium which was built for community use was not being used according to the facility director we met with the stadium field had not been used because it was not designed correctly to host football soccer games and did not have a functioning irrigation system sigar explained sigar found that the facility and grounds suffered damage because the afghan national directorate of security nds used the stadium as a base for military operations during a heavy period of fighting against taliban forces from april to june  a significant portion of the wasted money went to project like this  infrastructure construction that lacked oversight to ensure that it was built properly and was thus useless in another instance contractors were paid to build staircases leading to the ceilings  not the roofs  of single story buildings while most of the waste went to incompetence some went to crime an afghan subject stole a firetruck and a pick up truck from a us military base and sold them the combined value of the vehicles was   in another instance sigar investigators found that individuals were fraudulently selling us embassy kabul meal cards through their investigation our investigators found that the theft had been going on for  years and the department of state lost between  and  monthly for total of a  million loss sigar recommended american officials dedicate more time to ensuring that money goes to initiatives not suffering from a lack of clear program goals performance measures or quality data to support managerial decisions and ineffective monitoring or oversight of program activities and reconstruction dollars the report arrives as the administration of president donald trump continues talks with the taliban and the legitimate government of afghanistan to negotiate a safe exit for the united states which has been involved in the country militarily for  years secretary of state mike pompeo attended the launch of talks between the two sides in doha qatar in september seeking an agreement from the taliban that it would not target us troops for attack or harbor international terrorists groups that could do damage to american interests in exchange america would agree to withdraw from the country the taliban has dramatically reduced attacks on american troops though it has increased attacks on afghan forces since the talks began during the launch of talks in doha taliban negotiators demanded the establishment of a sharia based legal system in afghanistan  which is already legally an islamic republic  and the freedom of all imprisoned taliban jihadis estimated to number in the thousands we want a government in which the holy quran is ruling the hadith of the messenger muhammad is ruling the hanafi school is there and the occupation is over mawlawi abdul kabir a member of the taliban negotiation team said

hong kong police escalated the use of violence against protesters this weekend the tenth since protests against communist party influence in the city began flooding closed off areas with tear gas and on one occasion allegedly shooting a protester in the eye the harrowing image of the young woman yet to be identified bleeding profusely from her eye socket inspired protesters monday to demand hong kong police give us the eye back in another video journalists caught police beating a complying protester and squeezing him into a pool of his own blood as the protester repeatedly told officers he

sign up for our newsletter never the outlet to shy away from the most absurd reaction to the news story of the day the guardian has offered its take on the european migrant rape epidemic courtesy of the marvellous absurdist gaby hinsliff she writes in her oddly named article lets not shy away from asking hard questions about the cologne attacks that journalists like her ignored the rotherham rape scandal in the uk for fear of helping the british national party sign up for our newsletter well thats not journalism thats political activism though its good to have the admission from ms hinsliff but what really takes the cake is the following liberals shouldnt be afraid to ask hard questions young german women thankfully enjoy historically unprecedented economic and sexual freedom with their expensive smartphones and their right to celebrate new years eve however they want the same isnt always true of young male migrants exchanging life under repressive regimes where they may at least have enjoyed superiority over women for scraping by at the bottom of europes social and economic food chain it is not madness to ask if this has anything to do with attacks that render confident seemingly lucky young women humiliated and powerless but even if it does the answer wouldnt be to halt immigration  even if that were possible which it isnt regardless of whether britain leaves the eu  just in case a few immigrants are sexually aggressive any more than the answer to savile is to keep all men away from children lets break it down lets ask the hard questions she says but what precisely is hard about effectively claiming that migrants are simply venting their frustrations on the private parts of privileged western women thats not even a question if she were claiming that north african and arab men might have blue balls because where they come from women are covered from head to toe i might understand then again women in arab and north african countries are so severely repressed and crime reporting so low that we can assume rape is not so much an epidemic as it has become in europe since the migrant invasion but more endemic as justified by draconian laws which place the onus on the woman not to be raped and require four male witnesses before any conviction can be brought and then its usually the woman punished no this isnt a hard question at all shes saying hey you with the smart phone hike up your skirt and drop your knickers youve had it too good for too long dont you know these men need their release young german women thankfully enjoy historically unprecedented economic and sexual freedom with their expensive smartphones and their right to celebrate new years eve however they want victim blaming basically she had it coming the migrants have been repressed well journalists should probably be a little more responsible than making broad assumptions she doesnt know who these migrants are the doesnt know where theyve come from who they were before the syrian civil war broke out maybe they were local doctors or government officials or police who knows but no lets just assume theyve been repressed because it fits the narrative of us feeling so sorry for them that we offer up our young women in apology also  who cares if theyve been repressed repression isnt a licence to rape theyve enjoyed superiority over women where theyre from yeah so theyre not in bongo bongo land anymore oops and there have been any number of educational programmes tv shows pamphlets and outreach schemes for these migrants to tell them things like rape is bad mmkay this is another stupid excuse because it kind of admits we knew this was a possibility which in turn admits were sacrificing western women on the alter of mass migration thats a big admission and one ms hinsliff has made without realising it the answer wouldnt be to halt immigration  even if that were possible which it isnt regardless of whether britain leaves the eu challenge accepted follow raheem kassam on facebook and twitter comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

prices fell in december indicating us businesses are not passing on the costs of tariffs to consumers the labor department said wednesday that its producer price index fell in december compared with the month prices were down  percent economists had forecast a slight price gain for the month the index for final demand goodswhich are those most likely to translate into consumer pricesmoved down  percent in december the same as in november food prices rose absent food and energy final demand prices rose  percent one reason for the very tame inflation data is the steep drop in the price of oil absent the volatile food and energy categories prices of goods fell just  percent gasoline prices fell  percent in december and overall final demand energy prices dropped  percent inflationary pressures have been easing producer prices advanced  percent in november and  percent in october on an unadjusted basis prices were up  percent compared with december  that is a move down from the year over year price gain of  percent recorded in november and it matches what was recorded in december of last year in other words the december price gains were no higher than what was recorded before the trump administrations tariffs on steel aluminum and china imports were imposed price levels have held remarkably steady on most categories of goods in  defying predictions that american households would be squeezed by tariffs on steel aluminum and around  billion of goods made in china on monday chinas commerce ministry announced that it ran a trade surplus with the us last year that was the highest on record the us collected around  billion in tariffs in the october through december period around  percent more than the period a year prior price increases are more noticeable lower down in the production chain of materials and components that go into making final goods although recent data show that rise has moderated or reversed steel mill products for example fell  percent for the month but were up  compared with a year ago prices of materials used in durables manufacturingwhich are those most likely to be affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminumfell  percent on a monthly basis the third consecutive monthly declined for the year prices were up  percent a substantial slowdown in price increases compared with earlier readings prices of components for durables manufacturing rose just  percent on a monthly basis and are up  percent for the year prices of durable goods were flat in december the second month in a row of zero price increases compared with a year ago prices were up just  percent what this suggests is that the cost of tariffs is getting swallowed along the production process by each contributor from the buyers of raw metals to the producers of final goods and not reaching consumers another big metals using category is automaking here too there were many predictions that metals tariffs would push prices up and those predictions have been wrong car prices were down  percent for the month and are flat on an annual basis light truckswhich include pickups and many sports utility vehicleswere also down  percent for the month and are up just  percent annually prices of household appliances rose  percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in december reversing at least two consecutive months of declines for the year appliances are up  percent that one month gain could be the strongest indication in the numbers that the second china tariffs pushed up prices but prices can be volatile month to month especially around the holiday still this category is worth watching another category that could be hit by the china tariffs however was flat for the month home electronics for the year prices were down  percent the lack of transmission through the chain of production suggests that it is wrong to assume that consumer prices are determined by businesses setting their price as a markup over production cost if that were the case the prices on final goods included in the ppi would move up when intermediate materials prices move up given muted wage increases over the last several years as well as an increase in inequality that has seen much of the economic gains in recent decades concentrated with the very wealthy it may not be possible for businesses to pass on higher costs consumers cannot afford to pay more instead it appears that the markups are fallingreducing profit margins of american businesses these were bolstered however by very significant cuts in the tax rates paid by american businesses tariffs may simply be offsetting some of the profit gains from tax cuts the evidence from decembers ppi data suggest what all price data since the trump administration began imposing tariffs have suggested consumers do not necessarily pay for tariffs at least in the short run the producer price index is an alternate inflation measure where the more familiar consumer price index measures prices paid by consumers the ppi measures prices received by producers they tend to move in sync with one another although there can be gaps between the two measures the ppi data demonstrate that while some businesses are paying higher prices they have not passed those on to consumers please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
polls are showing donald trump gaining on hillary clinton in colorado even as team clinton thought the centennial state was wrapped up democrats now worry that mail in voting and lack of enthusiasm among progressives could be hurting clinton in colorado even hillarys internal polling is showing the race tightening and outside surveys tend to agree trump is on the rise in colorado despite spending little time or money there aside from funding two dozen offices and paying up to  staffers team clinton stopped putting campaign money into colorado as far back as the beginning of august imagining that colorado was firmly in the clinton camp but the new polling is shaking democrats self assuredness the washington post says polls early in august showed clinton leading trump by  points but hillarys internals now show that lead dropping to only seven points and other polls show trump has narrowed the gap to even five points in a four way race with the libertarian and green parties still another survey shows trump only two points down in a head to head race with clinton the paper noted aside from the tightening polls the post cites several other worries that are suddenly dogging clintons colorado backers first they worry that enthusiasm for clinton is at a low ebb this is a chronic problem for clinton all across the country as donald trump continues to speak to packed houses everywhere he goes clinton has often had problems filling venues and democrats have been fretting about the enthusiasm gap all year another worry seems to be the states unique mail in ballot scheme some democrats worry that many young voters may skip voting altogether over the rigmarole of filling out a paper ballot putting it in an envelope and finding a stamp to mail it inespecially since so many young people are geared to the electronic age still trump has as few as ten offices state wide and has only this month begun to air tv commercials after clinton dominated the airwaves all summer trump likely has a long way to go in a state filled with voters to whom pundits say he doesnt appeal follow warner todd huston on twitter warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonelhotmailcom comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

joe biden the presumptive democrat nominee is under mounting political pressure not to debate president donald trump this fall in recent weeks a bevy of political strategists pundits and even allies have intensified their efforts to push the former vice presidents campaign into reneging on the three customary presidential debates much of the effort has played out in the public eye spanning across the editorial pages of the nations leading newspapers network television and even social media some of the arguments utilized by proponents of jettisoning the debates center around trumps refusal to release his tax returns and the presidents proclivity for making untruthful or embellished statements i worry about joe biden debating donald trump he should do it only under two conditions otherwise hes giving trump unfair advantages the new york times columnist thomas friedman wrote last month asserting that it was imperative for the incumbent to make his tax returns transparent and for both candidates to agree to the inclusion of a real time fact checking team for the debates ten minutes before the scheduled conclusion of the debate this team report on any misleading statements phony numbers or outright lies either candidate had uttered freidman wrote that way no one in that massive television audience can go away easily misled a similar sentiment was echoed on sunday by joe lockhart a noted democrat strategist who served as press secretary for the clinton era white house during an appearance on cnn its a fools errand to enter the ring with someone who cant follow the rules or the truth lockhart said biden will undoubtedly take heat from republicans and the media for skipping the debates the strategist added that any potential blowback over skipping the debate was worth the risk as trying to debate someone incapable of telling the truth is an impossible contest to win although much of the argument for skipping the debates has revolved around fears that trumps will use the forum to spread inaccurate information some strategists and pundits have ventured further a few including former hillary clinton adviser zac petkanas have urged biden not to feel obligated to throw trump a lifeline by granting him any debates at all in the face of the presidents sinking poll numbers petkanas justification for such an act is that this is not a normal presidential election and trump is not a legitimate candidate others meanwhile claim that presidential debates have outlived their usefulness and no longer serve as a gauge of political acumen or ability the debates have never made sense as a test for presidential leadership elizabeth drew a noted author and political journalist wrote in an op ed published by the times on monday in fact one could argue that they reward precisely the opposite of what we want in a president the pressure comes as biden has agreed to take part in only the customary three debates between the republican and democrat presidential candidates trump who last year floated the idea of skipping the debates in general has made an aggressive push for more debates and less constrained rules the presidents staff in particular has argued that decreasing the role of the debate moderators would give the candidates an opportunity to frankly discuss the most pressing issues facing the nation americans would like to have more than three  minute opportunities to watch their two party nominees battle it out kellyanne conway a senior aide to the trump white house said on monday the prospect of additional debates has been a non starter for bidens campaign especially as some on the left are worried that even three debates could be potentially damaging to the former vice presidents white house ambitions most notably many fear that if bidens penchant for gaffes resurfaces during the televised encounters it could hurt the wide lead he has established over trump in most polls biden himself has not addressed that likelihood instead choosing to remain optimistic last month after a speech in delaware the former vice president told reporters that he could hardly wait to face trump on the debate stage please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
professors at florida international university fiu are now demanding the institution implement sanctuary campus policies where illegal immigrant students would be shielded from federal immigration laws in a letter to university officials professors from fius gender and anthropological studies departments asked that the university develop a plan for protecting undocumented students and refuse to cooperate with any efforts to identify detain or deport undocumented students even if daca is repealed or any other laws or policies change the miami new times reported daca is the deferred action for childhood arrivals enforced by the obama administration which allows illegal immigrant students to go to college legally under president elect donald trumps proposed immigration crackdown daca would likely be thrown out asking illegal immigrants to return home and enter through the country legally the letter goes on to claim that trumps proposed immigration policies have students worried writing as educators at florida international university one of the largest and most diverse american universities  our top priority is our students we are deeply worried about the dangers of a trump presidency to their well being and to the educational mission of our university the university professors continued this movement draws on a tradition of providing safe haven to vulnerable populations that dates back to the refusal of individuals and institutions to comply with fugitive slave laws the professors wrote in that spirit we call on our administration to declare florida international university a sanctuary sanctuary campus policies like the fiu policy being proposed mirrors sanctuary city policies which allow cities in the country to circumvent federal immigration law and protect illegal immigrants who are accused of committing violent crimes in philadelphia where sanctuary city policies take precedent the local police released a dominican national who was accused of child rape as breitbart texas reported under such sanctuary campus policies illegal immigrant students who commit violent crimes on or off campus would be shielded from deportation john binder is a contributor for breitbart texas follow him on twitter at jxhnbinder please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

during fridays democratic weekly address representative kim schrier d wa touted hr  the elijah e cummings lower drug costs now act and stated that in her purple district what she hears from constituents is not impeachment its not whats on the front page of the newspapers in washington dc its what are you going to do to bring down the cost of prescription drugs transcript as follows hi im congresswoman kim schrier im proud to represent the th district in washington i am the first pediatrician elected to congress and currently the only female doctor in congress i am also a patient with type  diabetes my life depends on insulin so the high cost of prescription drugs affects me and people like me every day thats why im so excited about hr  the elijah e cummings lower drug costs now act and am thrilled it passed the house i represent a really big really purple district i have driven over  miles this year traversing my district and talking with people about the issues that matter to them in my district its not impeachment its not whats on the front page of the newspapers in washington dc its what are you going to do to bring down the cost of prescription drugs because it doesnt matter if you are a democrat or a republican if you cant afford your medications you want a representative in congress who will go to bat for you because medications wont make you healthier if you cant afford to buy them i understand this issue both as a doctor and as a patient because it is not theoretical for me or for my patients when we talk about the cost of insulin i have felt that personally i have seen the price of my insulin go from  twenty years ago to  today that is the price for a bottle that holds  ml  two teaspoons this is not a medication you can choose not to take if you dont take insulin you die its that simple and so it is unconscionable that the price has jumped seven fold in  years nothing else sees that kind of inflation before being elected to congress i worked for nearly  years as a pediatrician in the suburbs of seattle three hours from the canadian border i would ask parents to call me from the pharmacy if they couldnt afford the medications i had prescribed there is so little transparency in pricing that even the doctor doesnt know what price any given patient will pay mostly i prescribed electronically but when patients asked for a printed prescription i understood why they would drive up to canada with those prescriptions because in canada the  insulin costs  and for my little patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis their enbrel and humira cost a small fraction of us prices just across the border right now americans pay  on average  three to four times what our neighbors in canada or people in france germany england australia and japan pay for their medications we should not be subsidizing the rest of the developed worlds medications and that is why we just passed hr  the lower drug costs now act this is groundbreaking legislation that will make a meaningful difference in the lives and in the health of americans in every one of our districts here are the pillars of this bill it gives medicare the power to negotiate the price of prescription drugs this will start with insulin and the most expensive medications it then extends the lower prices to private payers so everybody wins no longer will american seniors and families be forced to pay more for our medications than what drug companies charge for the exact same drugs overseas it also caps out of pocket medication expenses for seniors at  a year many seniors live on a fixed income and no senior should have to choose between taking their medication or putting food on the table this bill saves taxpayers more than half a trillion dollars and were going to use that money well one of the ways is a bill i have introduced that broadens medicare coverage to include eye exams and eyeglasses for seniors this is a tremendous gap in coverage for the people who need glasses and vision care the most look this bill is pretty darn groundbreaking and im optimistic about this bill being signed into law this is because the american people want it and our president has said he believes we should negotiate the price of prescription drugs i know that my district cant be all that different from the districts represented by my republican colleagues all of our constituents are looking to us to fix the problem of out of control drug price inflation lowering prescription drug costs is the centerpiece of the democrats for the people agenda i am so pleased today to deliver hr  for the people we all serve now i call on my colleagues in the senate to pass the lower drug costs now act the american people cannot wait another day for this to become law follow ian hanchett on twitter ianhanchett please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
well there goes spartacus slain by a fellow warrior supposedly fighting for the same side not that sen cory booker ever had any real shot at the democratic nomination for president considering the angry lust for socialism that drives democratic politicians in washington these days well that and an unstinting hatred of president trump as left wing and riled up as spartacus is he is simply no match for the fever dreams spun by the rest of the crazies in his party all vying for the holy grail for example take michael bloomberg the white billionaire in gucci pumps is flaying himself over every effort he made back when he was mayor of new york city to fight crime and make the city a remotely livable place now that he is whoring himself out and opening his wallet to buy the democratic nomination mr bloomberg has gone to california  a blueprint he says for the rest of the country i think that california can serve as a great example for the rest of the country he said during a recent visit to the high tax state that people are fleeing in droves you have led the way on climate change on fighting gun violence and on criminal justice and you have as importantly welcomed immigrants with open arms because unlike our president you understand immigration doesnt threaten america immigration strengthens america no wonder the guy is trying to buy the election he certainly could never win an election on the issues california a blueprint more like a petri dish infected with leper sores fecal deposits and discarded bloody needles truly california has become a hotel you can never check out of but thank goodness mr bloomberg is still running for the nomination of a party that is completely obsessed with the color of everybody now that mr booker has dropped out mr bloomberg is among the only people of color left in the democratic race green being the color of himself and tom steyer the retired hedge fund billionaire with white skin who is trying to outbid mr bloomberg for the nomination there has been debate recently  and i am not kidding  among democrats and some in the media over whether andrew yang qualifies as a person of color since he is of asian descent apparently these people are not sure his color counts as a positive since it would be used against him if he applied for admission to an ivy league university seriously this is how ridiculous the democratic party and your media have become in any event the party must go on even if no black or hispanic candidates are included in the next debate hosted by the democratic national committee et tu spartacus  charles hurt can be reached at churtwashingtontimescom and on twitter on charleshurt please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

sign up for our newsletter the republican establishment was totally humiliated and annihilated monday night in iowa and the carnage to the gop e segment of the washington cartel goes deeper than just the readily apparent the obvious defeat of course is the   finish by ted cruz and donald trump controlling more than  percent of the vote between them when you throw in the support for ben carson rand paul mike huckabee and rick santorum  the anti establishment vote tops  percent moreover the classic and once favored establishment candidate jeb bush barely registered ditto for john kasich the most establishment of all with his rhetoric and for chris christie that triumvirate are really the heart of the typical establishment cabal and they combined for barely over  percent yes only  percent do the math citizens by an  to  ratio over the long time establishment figures we have never seen anything like that in a republican caucus or primary ever it was proclaimed here at breitbart on christmas eve fact that we have in fact turned the corner and are now beating the dc cartel last night was just a validation of that theme now i know youre saying but wait what about marco rubio and his strong third place showing of  percent i realize obviously that fox news and other establishment leaning outlets are co opting rubio as the new insider champion and certainly with his dalliances and dithering regarding the gang of eight and immigration he fits their criteria to a degree and he has certainly attracted some typical republican donors and consultants but rubio in many ways is hardly the quintessential establishment champion he is no bob dole george hw bush john mccain or mitt romney hes not a paul ryan or a john boehner  and hes nothing much like john kasich the fact that the cartel is now going to have to hitch their wagon to rubio shows just how desperate they are  and it proves that we are now playing on their side of the  yard line rubio immigration notwithstanding has a far more conservative record than the figures mentioned above whats more he burst onto the scene by running charlie tanning bed crist slap out of the republican party at the time his was the first takedown of a well heeled establishment figure by someone ostensibly out of the tea party movement the key phrase here is at the time  which was  but it was the first and its dangerous to assume that later successes by paul cruz and mike lee would have happened without this stunner taking place first well never know its also important to remember just how deeply loved and admired crist was by the washington establishment he was a popular sitting governor of a state the republicans must win to have any chance of occupying the oval office he fancies himself gq good looking and his extraordinarily manicured image was almost a caricature of itself beyond that he has typical washington squishy reflexes always moving to the center and living in a politically correct world he was perhaps the very essence of the republican establishment  at least from those outside washington and it was rubio who made sure he never got to washington just like the scott brown winning the kennedy seat in massachusetts it was a seminal stepping stone success  regardless of how brown and rubio evolved once elected  which both clearly have now six years later the one time establishment killer rubio is the establishments only choice this is not how it was supposed to play out were not playing on their side of the   were inside the  but theres more in a little discussed topic even establishment tactics tried in the last three days by some non establishment candidates were exposed as stale losing strategies this may end up being as teachable as the other direct candidate results consider huckabee and santorums campaigns both ran establishment type attacks on cruz in the last  hours before the caucus they clearly bombed moreover trump attacking cruz  on abc and msnbc no less  and using liberal code words like heartless and nasty also come straight out of the karl rovehaley barbourthad cochranjohn mccain playbook trump also hurt himself with continued praise of doing deals like the corrupt ethanol crony scam as well as some extremely disturbing comments on health care that could be interpreted as left of bernie sanders and barack obama on the topic and lets not forget establishment governor terry brandstad going full mcconnell on cruz  saying anybody but ted cruz must win iowa that tone deaf pronouncement from a family enriched by government ethanol monies could have been followed by the disclaimer that im ted cruz and i approved this message we know this because something happened down the stretch four days ahead trump had all the momentum and virtually every poll lead these aforementioned tactics mostly took place in that short window of time and clearly they helped a cruz campaign that had lost its footing in the final weeks it was establishment tactics from non establishment candidates that put cruz over the top it was a near total defeatof establishment candidates and tactics and campaign templates  and for tells that things have changed in a tectonic way new hampshire might become a slight wiggle in this equation but after that its south carolina and thats nearly certain to be another humiliating night for the gop e edmund wright is a

the manson family appropriately laid roots for much of its short existence at the spahn movie ranch a fading set popular in an older black and white cowboy crazy hollywood but used for horse rides and an occasional shoot a bonanza here a softcore porn movie there as westerns waned in the public imagination if the manson familys existence were a movieand it later became several moviesspahn ranch might serve as setting and foreshadowing and metaphor like the run down ranch its tattooed hirsute inhabitant never quite made it in the entertainment industry in the late s so he exacted his revenge on that industry after taking guitar lessons from alvin karpis once the fbis public enemy  at mcneil island penitentiary charles manson petitioned the criminal with connections to land him gigs in las vegas karpis refused the year following his release the parolee made his own connections in the business befriending beach boys drummer dennis wilson who provided manson and his growing harem a more lavish place to live than spahn ranch in exchange mansons women supplied sex and housekeeping then as nowthe current scandals embroiling hollywood surely demonstrate thismen used sex as a means of gaining power in the entertainment industry with more than a dozen girls and young women many of them extremely attractive and some of them underage mesmerized by the gurus spell manson empowered himself to gain an audience with powerful men who might otherwise dismiss him by giving them use of the bodies of his acolytes the group cozied up to others in tinseltown manson recruited dean martins daughter deanna to whom he presented a ring to join the familyto no avail manson so impressed neil young who later called him stone brilliant and compared him to bob dylan that he gave him a motorcycle and recommended that reprise records sign him jackson browne already an accomplished songwriter in his teens though years away from releasing an album considered linking up with the family before record producer terry melcher warned him against it manson wooed deirdre lansbury who soon allowed the family to crash at mother angela lansburys house raid its closets and run up bills on the actresss credit cards but the group made their deepest connection with dennis wilson dianne lake who lived at wilsons rented log mansion in  described weekly acid trips and nightly sessions of group singalongs or group sex for over six months id been listening almost nightly as charlie told us that all we had to do was ask the universe for what we wanted and it would be presented lake recalls in member of the family in connection with dennis wilson it appeared that was precisely what had happened charlie had led us to the communal promised landeverything hed asked for had come to pass manson called willing a desire into existence through thoughts a postulation and the idyllic life in a southern california mansion with a swimming pool in the backyard appeared to validate his take on mind over matter but after an enraged manson lashed out at the beach boys for constructive criticism in the studio and his harem outside alienated and excited party goers by swimming and prancing around brian wilsons property in the nude dennis wilson cut ties lake one of the nude girls cavorting that day recalls in a new memoir that it was hard to shake the nagging feeling that something very real had been permanently lost when doris days son terry melcher who produced the first two byrds albums rebuffed manson this sent the former car thief pimp and peddler of bad checks to ponder more diabolical crimes the manson family soon traded in a luxurious existence for death valley worse still their jilted leaders dreams of stardom morphed into a nightmare of murder neil young interpreted the murders as manson punishing people for the fact that he didnt make it in the music biz thats what that was all about didnt get to be a rock and roll star so he started fin wipin people out on august   at  ciello drive a home recently owned by melcher mansons followers murdered actress sharon tate her unborn child hollywood hairstylist jay sebring coffee heiress abigail folger her boyfriend aspiring screenwriter wojciech frykowski and steven parent a teenager with the bad luck of visiting the propertys caretaker that night the following evening they murdered leno and rosemary labianca at  waverly drive a property once owned by walt disney the family dropped acid at a neighboring house the year before susan atkins explained their intention to instill fear into the establishment that they did and when atkins began boasting of her groups exploits and plans to fellow prisoners that fear grew the story she related virginia graham would say much later was even more bizarre than what susan had already told her ed sanders wrote in the family it was so incredible that virginia didnt even mention it to fellow inmate ronnie howard no one would believe it she decided for susan atkins in one spurt of non stop talking gave her a death list of persons who would be murdered next all were celebrities she then according to virginia described in gruesome detail exactly how elizabeth taylor richard burton tom jones steve mcqueen and frank sinatra would die peter sellers yul brenner warren beatty and others put up a  reward leading to the killers of director roman polanskis wife their unborn child tates three houseguests and a bystander at sebrings funeral which steve mcqueen attended with paul newman and henry fonda the bullitt and great escape star carried a gun with the murderers behind bars and their motives growing clearer the case began to envelop four stars shining even more brightly than mcqueen the beach boys and roman polanski inside the jail the manson women wrote science fiction writer robert heinlein in an effort to raise money not knowing the gravity of their crimes heinleinwhose character valentine in a stranger in a strange land gave mansons son his nameoffered vague words of support but no financial support messages to four writers of a musical sort went unanswered manson hangers on outside the courthouse wondered why the beatles refrained from reaching out to the group of people who so obviously best understood their music which they reasoned provided the rationale for partaking in helter skelter the dream can be real when you see it and when you live it catherine share who starred in an adult movie with manson family murderer bobby beausoleil filmed at spahn ranch told rolling stone and thats what the beatles are singing about theyre singing its all a dream life passes by on a screen theyre singing it but theyre still asleep singing it they havent woken up to the fact that what theyre singing about is more than a song they could be living it they have the powerand this is directed to themif they would realize how much theyre the ones then just the point of their finger could send  people back to the desert they could point to charlie and say this is the man whos saying what were saying lets all get together on it alas john paul george and ringo broken up by this point anyhow did not lift a finger let alone point one they just let it be and like so many others in the entertainment industry let charles manson down while mansons vision of a music career eclipsing the beatles never became reality as so many of the conmans postulations did his dream of celebrity certainly came to fruition manson who possessed some talent as a songwriter gained fame in a way that few before him but too many in his wake did if you could not join em kill em the black hat won notoriety in the manner that the silver screen cowboys once did at spahn ranch by killing people like that dilapidated set he struggled to make it in late s showbiz in a time of political assassinations bombings riots and war manson represented not so much a departure from the age as a reminder of what lay under its peace and love veneer he disturbingly proved that one neednt go platinum or  at the box office to launch fan clubs and become a celebrity please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
the league of united latin american citizens lulac took little time in filing the first lawsuit to try to stop the lone star states recently signed anti sanctuary jurisdiction bill lulac sued the state of texas its governor and the states attorney general the mayor of the small texas border city of el cenizo joined with the organization whose stated mission is to advance the economic condition educational attainment political influence housing health and civil rights of the hispanic population of the united states a sheriff and a constable from an adjacent county are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit el cenizo is in webb county right on the texas mexico border its population is approximately  and is  percent hispanic the city has long considered itself a safe haven for illegal aliens in  city officials passed an ordinance which prohibits city employees from asking a person about their immigration status el cenizo mayor raul l reyes and maverick countys sheriff tom schmerber and constable pct   mario a hernandez are the named plaintiffs in the lulac lawsuit against the state of texas governor greg abbott in his official capacity and texas attorney general ken paxton maverick county is adjacent to webb county just northeast of the county the league of united latin american citizens has filed suit against texas governor gregg abbott seeking to block implementation of sb  as a violation of multiple protections in the us constitution stated lulac national president roger c rocha jr we believe it is unconstitutional for the state of texas to attempt to coerce local law enforcement into becoming de facto federal immigration agents a statement obtained by breitbart texas from lulac provides the complaint which was filed by the league of united latin american citizens against the state of texas and key government officials seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from the courts to stop the state from discriminating against individuals based solely on the color of their skin the complaint which was the first to be filed by a civil rights organization in response to the signing of sb  maintains that sb  violates the us constitution the statute seeks to extend local law enforcement into a field preempted by federal law specifically sb  impermissibly extends immigration enforcement to local officials by forcing local government entities to cooperate with immigration enforcement efforts in a way that violates federal law both constitutionally and statutorily in addition to the statute being unconstitutional it is bad policy sb  will promote distrust between local law enforcement and the community at large breitbart texas reported in an exclusive interview with texas governor greg abbott that law enforcement and other officials who implement sanctuary policies and release criminal aliens with detainers will now be subject to the stiffest penalties in america governor abbott made these comments immediately following his signing of the historic bill that not only effectively outlaws sanctuary jurisdictions but provides for criminal penalties and removal from office if violated by law enforcement officials abbott also strongly refuted the attempts of left of center media legislators law enforcement officials and others that the so called controversial part of this law is what some label as the show your papers component he explained and what everyone seems to get wrong is they think that that provision was stricken down in the arizona law to the contrary the provision in the arizona law is stricter than the texas law the arizona law required that law enforcement ask for papers the texas law does not require it it allows it so there is that one difference but despite that difference the arizona law was upheld by every us supreme court justice including the liberals the so called controversial part of this law has been ruled on by the us supreme court and upheld the governor emphasized the author of the bill senator charles perry r lubbock said during a qa on the senate floor during final passage of the bill that police can already inquire about the immigration status of a person they detain he said this bill doesnt change anything in this regard and citizens and legal residents do not need carry papers to prove they are here legally as to criminal penalties for law enforcement officers that thumb their nose at the anti sanctuary law after it becomes effective on september  all law enforcement officers are going to be required to follow this law if they refuse to follow this law or if they adopt sanctuary city policies they are subject now to the stiffest penalties in america for adopting sanctuary city policies  which includes jail time where sheriffs could wind up in the same jail they may be releasing inmates from who are the subject of ice detainer requests but these officials also are subject to a removal action abbott advised and the counties or cities in which they operate are subject to very stiff fines the law makes ignoring an immigration detainer a class a misdemeanor breitbart texas reported when asked about travis county sheriff sanctuary sally hernandez and dallas county sheriff lupe valdez the texas governor had this to say during the interview if they dont change their policies if they continue to handle detainers on a case by case basis that means they will be in violation of this law and subject to its penalties the lawsuit filed in san antonio in the us district court for the western district of texas has been assigned to chief judge orlando l garcia judge garcia has ruled against texas in redistricting lawsuits brought against the state interestingly the federal complaint below bears the name bexar county constable pct  ruben c tejeda as a plaintiff but it has been manually scratched out the governor of texas believes this legislation will protect its citizens and free them from danger he clarified this law makes texans safer because it prevents the types of policies that california has that lead to the tragic murder of kate steinle it prevents the types of policies that were adopted by the travis county sheriff who had policies that release back out on the street people who are either accused of or even convicted of very dangerous crimes and so texas is going to be a safer place by ensuring that law enforcement will work with federal officials to ensure that we keep behind bars and remove from this country those who pose a danger to our fellow americans lulac lawsuit against texas on sanctuary city ban by lanashadwick

venezuelan president juan guaid who has no power in the country in practice claimed on monday that an aircraft belonging to libyan warlord khalifa haftar had arrived in venezuela a day before while guaids communications team had previously claimed haftar himself was in the south american country guaids statement said that only his plane had arrived guaid offered no further details baffling geopolitical experts while constitutionally the president of venezuela guaid has no enforcement power because the nations military answers to socialist dictator nicols maduro guaid made the announcement on haftar in remarks more broadly accusing maduro of ties to middle eastern terrorism highlighting in particular maduros ties to the islamic regime in iran supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei is one of maduros most vocal and consistent allies haftar a close military confidant of late dictator muammar qaddafi has struggled to wrestle control of the country how of the hands of the un recognized government of national accord gna since rebels killed qaddafi after storming his palace in  last year haftars army invaded tripoli the nations capital prompting a battle that is only slowly winding down last week reports suggest that the gna defeated haftars army on thursday prompting a slow withdrawal of forces the struggle between the gna and haftar had become a proxy war between his allies russia and egypt and the government of turkey which began sending supplementary forces to help the gna in january turkey entering the fray appeared to be the turning point that sealed haftars demise now guaid claims that haftar or at least haftars plane has left africa from venezuela there have been attempts to generate destabilization in some countries of the region i raise these flags of alert because it has to do with each of the nations of the region guaid said on sunday according to a statement from his embassy in the united states which added on sunday june th guaid warned that the airplane of the head of the self proclaimed libyan national army khalifa haftar had arrived in venezuela guaid did not say if he believed that haftar himself was on the plane nor did he specify any other potential passengers he did not elaborate on why haftar would choose to vacate to venezuela if he was indeed defeated guaid made the remark while warning generally of maduros known ties to terrorist organizations like the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc and hezbollah while iran hezbollahs patron has not explicitly supported haftar it is allied with russia haftars most prolific supporting regime reports indicate that veterans of the syrian civil war have also traveled to libya to aid haftar russia intervened in syria on behalf of irans ally dictator bashar al assad in may israeli ambassador to the united nations danny danon asserted that evidence existed of iranian weaponry landing in haftars hands in late  the presence of this advanced iranian manufactured system on libyan soil is another grave violation of security council resolution   as set forth in article  b of annex b which prevents the supply sale or transfer of arms or related materiel from iran danon said no public clarity exists on the nature of the relationship between hafter and maduro last week the wall street journal suggested citing anonymous sources that haftar had visited caracas seeking to make a deal with the socialist regime on selling and refining oil to better fuel russias importing of mercenaries to come to his aid the report did not specify when the caracas visit took place if it did both maduro and haftar have access to some of the worlds largest oil reserves but lack the infrastructure and competent staff to extract it maduro is facing strict sanctions against purchasing venezuelan oil from his regime and not guaids government as well neither side has confirmed the veracity of the report reports began surfacing of a potential retreat on khalifas part in tripoli in late may when observers noted what appeared to be the withdrawal of hundreds of russian and syrian fighters from the area by thursday mohamad gnounou a gna spokesman had declared victory in these historic moments we announce that all municipal boundaries of tripoli have been liberated he asserted islamist turkish president recep tayyip erdogan affirmed the victory on monday claiming that president donald trump supports turkeys backing of the gna the victories achieved by the libyan legitimate forces had made haftar go mad erdogan said on turkeys trt network trump is following closely the unfolding situation in libya and had praised turkeys efforts in libya the claim that trump praised erdogans intervention in libya contradicts trumps insistence in  that he believed there was no role for the united states in the struggle between the gna and haftars forces last year in the aftermath of haftar initially attacking tripoli trump reportedly reached out to the warlord and had a conversation with him in which according to the white house he recognized field marshal haftars significant role in fighting terrorism haftar has repeatedly claimed that sunni jihadist groups are aiding the gna the islamic state has taken credit for attacks on haftars forces follow frances martel on facebook and twitter please let us know if you re having issues with

two months ago after purchasing a digital copy of married with children my all time favorite sitcom i sold off my dvd collection of the show on ebay yesterday i again purchased the series on dvd so now i own two copies why well the blacklisters are blacklisting again and this time its the simpsons with the release of the hbo documentary leaving neverland that paints the late michael jackson as a serial child rapist james l brooks the guy in charge of the simpsons announced he is pulling banning blacklisting an early and iconic episode where jackson lent his voice to guest star getting the episode off all the platforms and outlets that carry the show  including streaming services tv stations and blu raydvd box sets  wont happen overnight the wall street journal reported and the process has started when i first read this i didnt give it much thought im not a simpsons fan now before yall start screaming sorry i dont like animation not even as a kid so ive not watched even five minutes of the simpsons but im certain you are  percent correct the show is awesome especially the early seasons and im no doubt missing something and will regret it and deserve to get hit by a train the washington posts sonny bunch is a simpsons fan though which means he gave this troubling news the weight it deserved and is now spreading the alarm it sets a precedent that anything that troubles or offends could wind up going down the memory hole alongside the michael jackson episode given the troubles simpsons producers have faced over the character of apu nahasapeemapetilon  whose voice as performed by hank azaria has been derided as grotesquely racist in recent years  can we really trust that access to classics like the pulp fiction parody  short films about springfield or homer and apu with its classic tune who needs the kwik e mart will remain accessible in perpetuity  if you dont own a physical copy of the thing you want to watch theres no guarantee that youll be able to access it at any time you choose your ability to access these materials depends entirely upon the whims of our corporate overlords  heres one thing thats never going to happen james l brooks is never going to march into my basement rifle through my shelves and abscond with my dvd collection of the third season of the simpsons an attachment to physical media remains the best defense against corporate censorship in a world where making problematic products disappear is becoming easier than ever  the ease with which companies can make your bits and bytes inaccessible should still give pause it was that last sentence that jolted me to my senses look at the extent to which these monolithic digital corporations have already gone to erase people from social media as a means to erase their ideas you know wild eyed stuff like men are men and women are women so of course entertainment deemed subversive and inappropriate by the fascist wokesters is next on the ever growing blacklist it only makes sense you might argue this cant happen in a country with a first amendment  please get your head out of the sand look around my friend and you will see that our government has farmed out the removal of our rights to mega corporations that have seized our means of communication and can legally silence us legally blacklist us legally blacklist their own art as james l brooks has now done disney blacklisted its own song of the south decades ago gone with the wind has been under fire for years and now you will no longer be able to purchase michael jacksons simpsons episode for the worst reason imaginable  like one of stalins filmmakers the shows own creator has been brainwashed into believing censorship is the right thing to do bunch argues against this censorship this way hiding the omnipresence of jackson in our cultural milieu does nothing to help us understand how the singer who was often surrounded by a coterie of young children could operate with impunity right under all of our noses which is fine but my reasons are nowhere near as lofty goddammit this is america we dont disappear art in america we dont judge art by the artist  good grief who in their right mind wants to go down that slippery slope of purity and heres something else and i know this isnt popular and i know i sound like one of those obnoxious pony tailed aclu defense attorneys everyone hates on law  order but michael jackson is innocent until proven guilty whats more jackson was tried for the crime hbos accused him of ten years after his death ten years after he could defend himself and found him not guilty oh but in the almighty kangaroo court of public opinion where we hide our bullying behind virtue  off with his head what is happening to this country is obscene and un

a trump campaign lawsuit in the state of michigan challenges ballots tabulated using dominion voting equipment on election day the lawsuit cites the well publicized incident in antrim county of a dominion voting machine mistakenly counting thousands of extra votes for former vice president joe biden instead of president donald trump the lawsuit asks that campaign challengers be physically present to observe and confirm the accuracy of the equipment wayne county used to tabulate the votes on election day ballots that were tabulated with defective or malfunctioning tabulating machines or software must be excluded from the tally or hand counted to confirm they are accurately counted and may be included in any certified canvass the lawsuit reads in a statement michigan secretary of state jocelyn benson said the issue was an isolated user error and the result of a failure to update the media drives for the vote tabulators but the trump campaign was not satisfied with bensons explanation her statement failed to provide any coherent explanation of how the dominion voting systems software and vote tabulators produced such a massive miscount the lawsuit reads wayne county which includes the city of detroit uses the same dominion voting tabulating system according to the trump campaign we want to make sure that no vote tally includes fraudulently or unlawfully cast ballots ballots tabulated by the dominion tabulating software until that software is validated and that any ballots received after election day both potentially postdated or predated need to be reviewed before that time trump campaign general council matt morgan said in a call with reporters we also ask through our lawsuit that were able to determine the accuracy of the tabulating equipment or software used in michigan he added campaign officials noted that the error was easy to catch in a smaller county like antrim county but questioned whether it was possible to detect in large counties of voters such as wayne county the lawsuit also notes that wayne county officials refused to test all of their machines with a representative from the trump campaign physically present instead the lawsuit claims officials only allowed one test of one machine on a zoom video call with a trump campaign observer the lawsuit asks the wayne county board of canvassers not to certify any ballots processed with the dominion tabulating equipment without proving that each machine is accurate there are so many irregularities in wayne county it was pervasive republican election lawyer thor hearne said citing more than  sworn affidavits of witnesses citing credible concerns about the voting and counting process the lawsuit also revisits the issue of voting officials in wayne county blocking trump campaign vote challengers from watching the counting process and even cheering when they were escorted from the premises also of concern are the voters in the system with the birthdate  detroits director of elections george azzouz defended the practice as a temporary placeholder for absentee ballots received just before election day obviously that is not a correct entry into the book and we need to validate those voters morgan said the lawsuit also seeks access to video footage of unattended ballot boxes to make sure that no illegal activity was recorded at the sites the lawsuit also cites accounts of election officials pre dating ineligible ballots so that they would count in the election please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

the new york times admitted july  that murder rates are spiking amid the  street protests and the progressive cheerleading for the radical defund the police campaign compared to early  murder is up  percent in all  large cities with  data through at least may said the new york times article under a misleading no news headline its been such a weird year thats also reflected in crime statistics according to the ny times murders are up  percent in democrat run chicago since february up  percent in democrat run philadelphia up  percent in democrat run nashville up  percent in democrat run new orleans up  percent in democrat run indianapolis and up  percent in democrat run new york but there is no political lesson amid the  corpses and carnage the new york times reassured its readers these numbers do not tell a story that supports any ideological side of the debate around policing mr goff said what it supports at most is a need for rigorous curiosity about a vital issue jennifer doleac associate professor of economics and director of the justice tech lab at texas am also says it is too early to draw any firm conclusions this is such a weird year in so many dimensions and its going to take us a while to figure out what caused any of these differences in crime it is perfectly reasonable to think the first half of this year may not tell us what the rest of the year will look like the ny times declined to say how many people died to deliver these percentage increases the ny times declined to mention the race of the killers and the dead after decades of steady decline the nations murder rates rose sharply after president barack obama tacitly supported s anti police riots and the black lives matter movement however the murder rates dropped quickly once president donald trump ended obamas policies the article was paired on the ny times home page with a second article under a subheadline nine children under the age of  have been shot dead in chicago since june  the article said as yasmin miller drove home from a laundromat in chicagos englewood neighborhood last weekend a gunman in another car peppered her red hyundai sedan with bullets grazing her head and striking her son sincere gaston in the chest sincere died in his car seat he was  months old  in all nine children under  have been killed since june  as chicago reels from another wave of gun violence the last two were killed on saturday evening a  year old boy was shot to death on chicagos south side a  year old girl was struck in the forehead by a bullet when three gunmen opened fire on a july  street party on the citys west side the police said the windy city is becoming the bloody city said the rev michael l pfleger of saint sabina church calling it the worst period in the  years he has worked on social issues i have never seen the despair hopelessness and anger all mixed together at the level it is right now the second article addressed the elephant in the room the violence comes amid a wrenching debate nationwide about policing in the wake of the death of george floyd in minneapolis at the hands of the police those who defend the police say that the violence shows they need more support not less and that it is people living in high crime areas who most need effective policing critics say the violence shows how the police are failing the public how deeply residents distrust officers and the need for reforms and the transfer of funds to address underlying problems including unemployment mental illness and drug use there are  blacks who are killed every year attorney general william barr told national public radio on june  eighty five percent of them are killed by gunshots virtually all of those are blacks on blacks he explained if put in perspective he argued the data on police involved shootings does not fit the narrative of the black lives matter movement  which goes as far as accusing police of genocide or saying that black americans are systemically targeted for demise barrs point on homicide and black americans has been acknowledged across partisan lines for instance in july  president obama said the statistics on this issue are crazy it is absolutely true that the murder rate in the african american community is way out of whack compared to the general population and both the victims and the perpetrators are black young black men the single greatest cause of death for young black men between the ages of  and  is homicide and thats crazy that is crazy a study produced by then president obamas doj provides similar data about murders and race from  to  the report noted blacks were disproportionately represented as both homicide victims and offenders the victimization rate for blacks  per  was  times higher than the rate for whites  per  the offending rate for blacks  per  was almost  times higher than the rate for whites  per  follow neil munro on twitter neilmunrodc or email the author at nmunrobreitbartcom

washington post columnist ej dionne jr claims the guilty plea of suspected russian spy maria butina and the outcome of the  congressional elections mark the beginning of the end for the gun lobby in the us dionne believes butinas plea keeps americans focused on the still unproven claims of russian collusion in the  election and he thinks the midterm elections indicate a shift in the electorate that favors the gun control lobby he writes taken together the events of  and the results of the  election will be remembered as the beginning of the end of the gun lobbys power dionne hedges his bets by admitting his frustration that the overthrow of the gun lobby may not be complete as quickly as leftists would like because of the vast over representation of rural states in the senate which tilts the system undemocratically toward those who claim that government is powerless to take meaningful steps against mass killings in making his point he completely overlooks the fact that the founders wanted the system to be undemocratic thus they created a republic with checks and balances to frustrate those seeking total control dionne goes on to lament our nations shameful immobility in confronting mass shootings but does not offer any ideas on how such crimes should be confronted he mentions gun control in general but provides no specifics he does point to a backlash against bill clinton as the birth of the gun lobbys power but even then does not explain that the backlash was against gun control  specifically the  assault weapons ban on december   the day before dionnes column was published  the nra reached  followers on instagram  not exactly a sign of diminishing influence or power

the chinese foreign ministry condemned the american company badger sportswear for announcing it would no longer purchase clothing from a company based in xinjiang where the communist government has built dozens of internment camps to house enslave and torture muslim minorities foreign ministry spokesman lu kang called it pathetic that the us company  which claimed it had no knowledge of its purchased shipments coming from xinjiang before the associated press ap exposed the origins of the clothing in a report late last year  had chosen not to do business with western china china initially denied the existence of the internment camps which are believed to house mostly ethnic uighurs kazakhs and kyrgyz people it has since branded them re education camps and claimed that they serve to provide job skills to muslims at risk of being enticed to join jihadist groups if this company has stopped trade exchanges with china based on some wrong information i think it is pathetic lu told reporters according to a translation by the state run global times newspaper the official website of the foreign ministry translated this as a pity rather than pathetic i want to stress that first china has abolished the reeducation through labor system lu claimed xinjiangs vocational skills and education training is totally different from the forced labor alleged by some parties lu made the comments while alleging that in principle china would typically not comment on private business dealings the global times backed lus claims asserting that its own reporting as a government owned entity revealed that the government was not guilty of human rights violations in the nations largest province during a visit to xinjiang in late october the global times found that in a satellite factory located in a village of shorebagh town the employees all voluntarily chose to work there and get paid the newspaper said citing the salary of one of these factories at around  a month the global times also published commentary on thursday attacking the united states for leading the efforts against the campaign to erase uighur culture and islam generally from xinjiang the state department was among the first entities in the world to reveal the existence of the internment camps and demand china answer for its crimes western countries and media outlets involved in the concerted anti china campaign blame the country for what they call social and cultural oppression of uyghurs in the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region the times claimed but when one sees the human rights record of the us it is not too hard to understand that the main aim of the allegations is not humanistic but political washington has put on the mask of humanity for years to discredit countries it doesnt agree with it alleged claiming that the internment camps were necessary because some chinese muslims have reportedly joined jihadist groups in the past the editorial also attacking media in countries like turkey  naming the belligerent pro turkish government publication yeni safak in particular  for reporting on the crimes against uighurs in china the uighurs are an ethnically turkic people and speak a turkic language with little in common with mandarin or other han languages the chinese government according to the ap report is building the factories in question within or in proximity to the re education camps where for nearly a year chinese officials have been forcing chinese muslims from xinjiang which borders afghanistan to learn mandarin memorize communist party propaganda songs worship communist party leader xi jinping and renounce their islamic faith camp survivors have told human rights groups that beatings and electrocutions are not uncommon for prisoners who reject the indoctrination no survivor has claimed the vocational camps have taught them anything other than communist propaganda or that they voluntarily imprisoned themselves there the ap added a new detail to the activities within the camps its december report cited survivors who said they were being forced to manufacture goods for no pay clothing is a common item made in the camps the relatives of prisoners in the camps say that the claim their children needed to learn a skill to have access to the chinese market does not make sense in the context of who is ending up in the camps  often lawyers doctors advertising professionals and others with stable employment reuters reported last year that it had evidence via satellite imagery of the existence of over  camps throughout the vast province previous reports estimated that as many as between  and  million people mostly uighurs but of other ethnic minorities as well are currently imprisoned in the camps the ap found that some of the clothing made in uighur internment camps found its way to the united states through purchases by badger sportswear which sells clothing to university apparel stores on wednesday after an internal investigation badger sportswear cut ties to its chinese supplier hetian taida which sold the us business the xinjiang clothing given the controversy around doing business furthermore we will not ship any product sourced from hetian taida currently in our possession badger added in a statement follow frances martel on facebook and twitter

thursday on fox news channels your world rep kevin brady r ca the ranking republican on the house ways and means committee discussed democrats using congressional power to obtain president donald trump tax returns from previous years brady said such a move would be an abuse of power and said there were other ways to examine his business dealings partial transcript as follows cavuto first off on the tax thing that theyre looking for democrats are looking for they want to go back quite some time but theyre  they think they have a rationale for getting taxes that they not been able to get up to now what is it brady yes they dont well look this isnt about whether the president should voluntarily release his tax returns you can say yes or no to that this is really about an abuse of power by congress the law today protects individual taxpayers from congress examining them and making them public for purely partisan reasons if democrats twist the law and weaponize the tax code for purely partisan reasons they have set a very dangerous precedent because if congress any congress can rummage around in the tax returns of the president what stops them from doing that for anything they think is a political enemy cavuto so what is the rationale theyre using for getting their hands on them now brady well they believe seeing the tax returns will help them identify any potential conflicts of interest perhaps within the tax code but this is an easy answer you can protect private taxpayers and still look at that for instance few people know that the president and the vice president are annually audited by the irs theyre subjects to epics reviews and investigation by the fbi thats already in place cavuto yes we should explain that the irs has to look into any sort of business dealings or relationships brady absolutely cavuto  as the president and vice president are conducting official government business right brady yes absolutely its already there and by the way if democrats want this president or future presidents to disclose more types of information then fine we have an annual financial disclosure we can by law say to any president or candidate look we want to know more about this and thats the way to do it the right way not by weaponizing the tax code cavuto so theyre not even looking for the current years though as president theyre going back wondering about whether he had business relationships that were nefarious or what have you but do you think whatever justification they have or do not have that someone running for the highest office in the land which is a grueling process and your whole life is an open book and theyre examining your kids and what you eat and all  i dont how people put up with it i dont know you put up with it that you should provide your tax records i mean you should get it all out there brady yes look i will tell you i dont think tax records frankly very insightful or revealing in fact most of what that triggers is by experts a very thorough review trying to sort of glean what those relationships are its a really bad way of doing it cavuto but theres a difference between your tax returns  and youre a big muckety muck  and  but someone like even the president of the united states who is a huge muckety muck and a very rich muckety muck do you think that there is value in a guy that wealthy  im not saying anything is untoward going on  but just to put it all out there get it all out there brady if there is theres a better way of doing it than the tax returns change the financial disclosure for example yes tackle that cavuto fine fine but do you think anyone running for president congressman anyone it should be required that they release their tax returns brady you know i dont know i will tell you in the past i have always seen it sort of as the gotcha game cavuto yes brady frankly i dont think its been very revealing i think the financial disclosures  and i keep coming back to that because thats where you really learn about relationships how much stake you havent businesses what are those relationships i actually think if thats the goal if thats a legitimate goal then look lets tackle that thats a fair way to do it follow jeff poor on twitter jeffpoor please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

north koreas army announced on wednesday it would begin repopulating areas where it had agreed to establish demilitarized cooperation zones with south korea its latest provocation since blowing up the north south joint liaison office on tuesday following a meeting between leftist south korean president moon jae in and communist dictator kim jong un in  the two countries agreed to establish the office as a base for meeting between diplomats from the two countries the office also featured a direct line on which representatives of both countries spoke twice a day pyongyang stopped answering south koreas calls last week after publishing a vitriolic statement from kim yo jong the dictators sister threatening military action if seoul did not act to stop human right activists from using balloons and other improvised devices to send leaflets with banned news of the outside world written on them into north korea although moons government ceded to north korean demands by persecuting the human rights activists the kim regime blew the joint liaison office up on tuesday anyway on wednesday a spokesman for the general staff of the korean peoples army kpa the armed forces of communist north korea announced the redeployment of troops to the former site of the joint liaison office and other previously demilitarized areas regiment level units and necessary firepower sub units with defense mission will be deployed in the mt kumgang tourist area and the kaesong industrial park where the sovereignty of our republic is exercised the spokesman said kaesong industrial park was the site of a failed joint project for economic development founded in  the joint liaison office was located in kaesong as well mt kumgang is the site of a former tourist area established to foster ties between north and south koreans shut down after a north korean soldier killed visiting a south korean woman the kpa also announced that civil police posts that had been withdrawn from the demilitarized zone under the north south agreement in the military field will be set up again to strengthen the guard over the front line areas that already boast a north korean military presence the statement continued would receive reinforcements and north korean soldiers would resume regular military exercises paused after the  talks the military also announced a new campaign of communist propaganda leaflets to be littered into south korea north korea has responded to information and humanitarian campaigns by south korean citizens in the past by dumping large amounts of used toilet paper and garbage into its neighbor the move followed threats on monday to use military force against the human scum against those who distribute leaflets or food goods like rice which humanitarian aid groups often use to fill water bottles and float them into north korea for the starving population by tuesday the kaesong joint liaison office had collapsed south korean officials believe that north korean workers at the office evacuated after leaving explosives throughout the facility this week then blew it up on tuesday north korea contributed no funds to constructing the joint liaison office which cost at least  million the statements signal the final nail in the coffin of a cross border military pact signed in  to reduce tensions and military presence in the frontline area the south korean conservative newspaper chosun ilbo observed the north has repeatedly violated the pact which mandated the demolition of some guard posts in the demilitarized zone and disarming of border guards in the truce village of panmunjom kim yo jong also issued yet another statement following the destruction of the joint liaison office on wednesday repeatedly insulting moon personally the korean central news agency kcna the official media outlet of north korea titled kims statement honeyed words of impudent man are disgusting the south korean chief executive finally broke his silence amid the north south relations inching close to the worst catastrophe kim yo jong reportedly said he reeled off a string of shameless and impudent words full of incoherence it is well known to everybody that the blame for the present grim situation rests with human scums scattering of anti dprk leaflets and the south korean authorities connivance at it the recent speeches made by the south korean chief executive should have reflected his apology repentance and firm pledge to prevent the recurrence of similar occurrences the statement continued but his speech was full of excuses and spurious rhetoric to get rid of responsibility without any mention of the means and the end he seems to be insane though he appears to be normal outwardly kim concluded of moon it is a senseless act to disparage moons speech earlier this week in a very rude tone without understanding its purpose at all yoon do han  the senior secretary for public communication in south koreas presidential office the cheong wa dae  responded in a flabbergasted statement to the press we wont tolerate any more of north koreas indiscreet rhetoric and acts which fundamentally harm the mutual trust the leaders of the two sides have built so far we hope the north side will have basic courtesy follow frances martel on facebook and twitter please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

sentencing reform a priority for his administration all told obama has commuted the sentences of  individuals more than the previous six presidents combined according to the white house the power to grant pardons and commutations embodies the basic belief in our democracy that people deserve a second chance after having made a mistake in their lives that led to a conviction under our laws obama said in his pardon letter he also visited non violent drug offenders in prison in  to call for more sentencing reform thats what strikes me there but for the grace of god obama said during the visit and that is something that we all have to think about yesterday obama admitted that although he used illegal drugs as a young person he was lucky that he didnt end up in prison or helplessly addicted i was lucky i dont know why he said friends of mine who ended up battling addiction were not less worthy or more morally suspect than i was for whatever reason things broke that way the president

the woke taliban at the nw film center have blacklisted kindergarten cop  from a scheduled screening after a local author whined about it being problematic the original idea had been to include the arnold schwarzenegger hit in a summer drive in festival the movie where arnold plays a cop who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher was filmed in oregon and the festival chose it for its importance in oregon filmmaking history watch below but then a shrill wokester named lois leveen a local portland writer who has since locked her twitter account fox news has the tweets went off on a crazed twitter rant demanding the movie be blacklisted from the festival whats so funny about school to prison pipeline kindergarten cop out tell nwfilmcenter theres nothing fun in cops traumatizing kids national reckoning on overpolicing is a weird time to revive kindergarten cop irl we are trying to end school to prison pipeline leveen shrieked theres nothing entertaining about the presence of police in schools which feeds the school to prison pipeline in which african american latinx and other kids of color are criminalized rather than educated leveen screeched   and  year olds are handcuffed and hauled off to jail routinely in this country and this criminalizing of children increases dramatically when cops are assigned to work in schools leveen wailed yes kindergarten cop is only a movie so are birth of a nation and gone with the wind but we recognize films like those are not good family fun they are relics of how pop culture feeds racist assumptions kindergarten cop romanticizes over policing in the us leveen bleated leveen has exactly  twitter followers and not only did the nw film center back down like quislings they are shamelessly claiming the tweets had nothing to do with their decision that the blacklisting came about after some internal soul searching resulted in overwhelming demand among staff and community members to remedy the historical horrors that come with kindergarten cop but as fox news points out when the quislings announced the decision to blacklist the movie they replied directly to leveen on twitter incredibly and i know youre all going to be shocked by this lois leveen still isnt happy still isnt satisfied i think what you meant to type was yes we made a grave error in not realizing the implicit racism in that programming decision we apologize and are rethinking who makes our programming decisions hereafter how deep a white normativity hole will nwfilmcenter keep digging lois leveen sure sounds like a load of laughs so instead screening an escapist crowd pleaser during these troubled times the quislings will instead screen the perfect friday night drive in feature a documentary about the recently deceased john lewis im sure the turnout will be huge whats the second feature a pbs filmstrip about how ice fishing exemplifies st century colonialism nothing is safe yall if you notice leveens mccarthyite screeching was not just about the police content it then shifted to something called a white normativity hole which means that the only thing thats not problematic to watch at the drive in on a friday night is a biography about john lewis or video of oprah reading toni morrisons beloved or a slam poet performing a two hour version of white normativity hole my issue isnt lunatics like lois leveen america has always been plagued by soulless dried up joyless fun hating bossy neurotic harpies my issue is that we are now caving to these soulless dried up joyless fun hating bossy neurotic harpies  when we used to ridicule them follow john nolte on twitter noltenc follow his facebook page here please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

president donald trump may not help americans if he blocks foreign h b visa workers from getting the white collar jobs sought by unemployed americans says a may  report by a business boosted pro migration group the national foundation for american policy there is little reason to think doing so will help american workers says the report authored by madeline zavodny at the university of north florida the study relies on data from  to  to claim a correlation the presence of h b visa holders are associated with lower unemployment rates and faster earnings growth among college graduates including recent college graduates the report comes as business groups lobby president donald trump not to curb the visa worker program amid the coronavirus crash and the  reelection campaign on april  trump directed his agencies to review the visa worker programs that keep an army of roughly  million white collar visa workers in the united states the foreign workers are imported via the h b l  opt cpt head tn and b  programs opponents say the visa programs reduce americans salaries and displace many graduates from starter jobs and mid career jobs zavodny downplays the displacement writing the results indicate h b visa holders do not adversely affect us born college graduates during the early years of their careers yet in a  study zavodny recognized that immigrants can push americans out of technology careers we find some evidence that immigration adversely affects whether us born women who graduated from college majored in a science or engineering field said a summary of her study does immigration affect whether us natives major in science and engineering more established older american workers are relatively immune from such h b competition zavodny wrote in her new report despite many lawsuits and much data showing massive displacement of american workers however ben prusinki a us database expert provided contrary evidence in september  i want to say is that the most destructive thing in this country to the american worker from my experience has been the guest worker visa program prusinski said adding there are multiple versions of this that president bill clinton and president george w bush passed in the s that impacted the american worker in a very severe way h b head opt visas numerous visas that originally were intended to provide special needs for corporations that couldnt find hard to fill positions unfortunately this process has been abused to import cheap labor into this country and also to outsource of lots of highly skilled jobs to india and china in my prior job at hitachi data systems i worked as a master architect with storage compute and database systems and i was very qualified for this position but my job was sent overseas to india hitachi used a third party indian contract agency that staff a lot of their itoracle jobs and my boss specifically went to india on a business trip for that purpose i cant say anything else about that for legal reasons because of my severance agreement i signed with hitachi over a year ago but thats just one example years ago this started when i worked for dc government as a contractor on oracle e business suite project and i was replaced by an h b visa worker and the following week this particular indian national on h b visa was crying calling me and begging me to help him with his oracle database issue but i had been let go replaced by him so i told him im not getting paid so im not going to train you to do your work because you replaced me on this job i wish you best of luck but youre supposedly qualified you should be able to do the work so right now in september  the situation im faced with is ive been out of work for a year my unemployment benefits are exhausted im running out of funds to pay my rent and my food and im on food stamps its embarrassing i have the skills for most of these it database jobs and i have the proven work history and skills to do them what is happening is that im applying for hundreds and hundreds of these database jobs as soon as i apply within  hours i get an instant rejection email saying mr prusinki youre qualified but were looking at better candidates the other thing that happens is i go on interviews at sony in san diego california were i interviewed it was over  percent indian nationals in the database field also another company i interviewed with a couple years ago was apple and as a shareholder in apple this really pisses me off because i interviewed for a database job at apple in sunnyvale california and it was all indian nationals now you cannot tell me there are no qualified americans to do the job or myself and millions of americans have the skills and technology and youre hiring foreign nationals into these positions that qualified americans like myself can do the work i didnt get the job i suffered a four hour interview of grilling by  indians at apple and as a shareholder of apple this really upsets me i will not buy any more apple products as long as i live as long as it continues to pre reject americans from the workplace because it violates the eocc laws it is unethical as well like i said i dont have anything against indians or chinese or any other ethnic group this is a labor issue that congress needs to investigate because it violates eeoc laws in hiring and it discriminates against all americans regardless of religion belief or national origin trump gets  public support for his americans first shift on immigration even  support from dems who  somewhat disapprove  of trump is strong evidence for a strategy of incrementalism vs a big rush for a total victory but deadline is nov hbhttpstcomdonvlbl  neil munro neilmunrodc april   zavodny offered two clashing explanations for her claimed correlation of h bs and higher wages for americans the existence of the h b program causes some employers to expand  or at least not decrease  the number of jobs open to rival american workers  and some employers turn to the h b program not because it enables them to hire workers more cheaply but because they cannot otherwise hire workers at all in the united states empahsis added but the first explanation is undermined by the fast growing unemployment rate that has released many americans from the jobs held by h bs the second explanation  the claimed lack of workers problem  can be ameliorated by the education sector or by higher salary offers to us professionals zavodny downplays the alternative explanation for her claimed correlation of h bs and wage increases from  to  that the huge supply of foreign h b workers did not take all the jobs in a fast growing economy for less skilled workers theres no question that immigration increases unemployment said mark krikorian the director of the center for immigration studies but he continued if you are reasonably well educated american working in say technology and you are displaced by a foreign worker such as an h b contract worker youll still probably find a job at a lower level of skill you can work at starbucks you could be doing a number of things because you have a higher level of skill but a lower skilled american does not have anywhere to go so it is not really telling us much that high skilled americans are not more likely to be unemployed amid immigration the question is are they employed in the occupation they used to have in current circumstances it is entirely possible that higher skilled americans might not be able to find any work many business groups democrats and even pro migration groups quietly admit that the supply of labor does impact the price of labor the fact that labor supply shapes wages has been admitted by independent academics the national academies of science the congressional budget office executives the economist globalist weekly more academics the new york times the new york times again state officials unions more business executives lobbyists employees the wall street journal federal economists goldman sachs oil drillers the bank of ireland wall street analysts fired professionals legislators the ceo of the us chamber of commerce  bernie sanders the wall street journals editorial board construction workers new york times subscribers robert rubin a new york times columnist author barack obama and president barack obama even the business roundtable argued in a report on migrant labor that average real hourly wages would decline by  cents by  due to increased slack in the labor market and fewer productivity gains each year the government admits roughly one million new legal immigrants as well as roughly  foreign contract workers even as  million young americans leave school to look for jobs careers marriages and homes that massive annual inflation of the new labor supply transfers enormous wealth from young employees to older shareholders from heartland states to coastal states and from small businesses to the stock market the nfap is run by stuart anderson whose bio at forbescom shows that he worked for pro migration gop legislators i am the executive director of the national foundation for american policy a non partisan public policy research organization focusing on trade immigration and related issues based in arlington virginia from august  to january  i served as executive associate commissioner for policy and planning and counselor to the commissioner at the immigration and naturalization service before that i spent four and a half years on capitol hill on the senate immigration subcommittee first for senator spencer abraham and then as staff director of the subcommittee for senator sam brownback anderson did not respond to calls from breitbart news theres no question that nfap is part of the business coalition that wants to keep the border open said krikorian whose group works to shrink migration nfap is entirely a creation of the tech lobby  they get to say whatever they want but there is a very specific financial interest in nfaps work when a lobbyist makes a claim it means you have to take it very skeptically said krikorian we dont want trumps temporary immigration policy to become permanent investors  progressives unite for extra migrants hbhttpstcosansckxv  neil munro neilmunrodc may   please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
sign up for our newsletter a romanian member of the european parliament has lashed out at europes approach to the cultural war with migrants and questioned the ability of europe as a cultural entity to continue in the face of the onslaught romanian mep laurentiu rebega is a member of the same europe of nations and freedom group as marine le pen and the front national having joined last year after he crossed the floor from the conservative party sign up for our newsletter speaking out in the immediate aftermath of the brussels bombing attack this week he told breitbart london that the flow of refugees to europe wouldnt end until there was peace in the middle east  a potentially unlikely prospect speaking of the migrants travelling to europe in ever greater numbers mr rebega said they cant be integrated they will never be integrated the people who attack europe are the people whose families came here  years ago they cannot adapt to our culture this shows we have a really big problem if we accept them in our cultural space we have this mass of people from mass migration who have penetrated europe without any control any debate even over how they can be part of our culture they come here they refuse to take part in any kind of process to adapt to our norms stopping this flow of migrants was paramount to the survival of european people he said in my opinion we have to stop this right away otherwise europe wont exist in ten years from now right now we are at war these people arent insane individuals who are out of control and who decide to attack us this is very well organised the brussels attacks shows they are starting a war against the europeans we have a duty to protect our own citizens we dont have one to care for others you might say we have to show humanity and compassion to migrants but now we see they are attacking our own citizens they kill innocent people when pressed on what the solution to these problems was mr rebega expressed there was much to be done but emphasised the importance of protecting the frontier he said the biggest problem we have now is the uncontrolled border there is no doubt about this we have no border control we have no say on who comes from other places enters with a different culture mr rebega explained he was particularly dissatisfied with the way the european union failed to support nations at the frontiers who were dealing with the day to day reality of mass migration he lamented we didnt help them we just talk and talk and force them to take mass migration comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

mcallen texas  a us postal service employee in this border city has pleaded guilty in federal court to taking money in exchange for sharing the names and addresses of mail ballot voters with democrat get out the vote operatives locally known as politiqueras tuesday morning  year old noe abdon olvera went before us district judge micaela alvarez and pleaded guilty to one count of bribery of a public official olvera is set to be sentenced in may at which time he faces up to  years in prison the case against olvera revealed that in october  olvera took  in exchange for names and addresses of residents in his postal route that received absentee ballots during the previous  democratic primary according to prosecutors olveras role was tied to the  hidalgo county sheriffs race the criminal indictment names a yolanda perez hidrogo as the woman who received the names and addresses however court documents reveal she has not been charged in the case hidrogo has been mentioned before in other cases dealing with the buying of postal addresses in connection with mail in ballots the mcallen monitor reported in january  in that case questions swirled as to whether three sitting members of the la joya independent school board bribed postal workers and illegally manipulated voters to get re elected the paper noted hidrogo purportedly authored a notarized affidavit in july  detailing her work as a self professed politiquera during city of mission elections at the timespecifically in support of incumbent mayor norberto salinas campaign my job was to handle the mail in ballots by meeting with the people who received them hidrogo wrote i would encourage them to choose mayor salinas and they would the politiquera claimed previous cooperation with noe olvera in  noting he was also paid to work the mail in ballots hidrogo gave insight into how the mailman electioneered even on government time noe rode with me a few times to to go talk to people he was making promises to a lot of people he told one lady that he was going to help her get her citizenship papers in return for for her vote for mayor salinas another man we picked up was mentally disabled and noe olvera promised him money for his vote after taking the man to vote noe did not pay him noe had given him a card with mayor salinas name on it so that he would know who to vote for on several occasions i would drive behind noe while he was on his mail route he would call me and tell me when he would deliver a mail in ballot at a home i would write down the addresses or i would stop by and talk to the people another day he called and told me that they had received a lot of mail in ballots and that he was going to write all the addresses down for me hidrogos affidavit notes a change of heart experienced later on in the campaign after she felt guilt toward her political boss opponent for showing a willingness to campaign cleanly she also recounted instances where people should not have voted i now feel that the system is very corrupt it isnt right i saw so many people being deceived there were people who should not have been voting due to mental health reasons one apartment had a lady who i believe had alzheimers and didnt really know what i was talking about i did not help her with the mail in ballot and i just left three days later i stopped by her daughters thanked me for not asking her to vote they also knew that someone else had gone by and had filled out her mail in ballot election law attorney and public interest legal foundation president j christian adams recalled this case was similar to one he pursued while in the bush justice department all under the honorable guise of voter assistance local political bosses accessed and leveraged absentee votes to score electoral victories adams said voter fraud is prevalent enough in absentee votingbut when mailmen are willing to work hand in glove with get out the vote staff it can become institutionalized adams argues that texas election law can do more to serve voters at a minimum mail voters should be required to provide identification proofs like seen in kansas that added safeguard better protects voters when their ballots are wrongfully intercepted adams added during the hearing olvera and his court appointed attorney marco de luna notified alvarez that they had conferred with assistant us attorney joseph leonard and were going to plea guilty to the charges the agreement revealed that prosecutors would recommend a lighter sentence in exchange as breitbart texas reported the sheriffs office was vacated in april  when former sheriff guadalupe lupe trevio pleaded guilty to money laundering charges for having taken money from a mexican drug lord living in south texas trevino remains

a number of religious freedom advocates have stepped forward to criticize the vaticans new provisional agreement with china on the appointment of bishops arguing that it betrays navet concerning the evil of communism the vaticans diplomatic rapprochement with the chinese government will likely exacerbate problems for the church in china said dr thomas farr in testimony before the house committee on foreign affairs last week in part by appearing to abandon those chinese catholics including bishops and priests who bravely speak out against religious persecution and on behalf of religious freedom and human dignity part of the vaticans concession to the chinese government in fact involved the rehabilitation of seven illicitly ordained bishops of the state controlled catholic patriotic association and the removal of two bishops of the underground church that have been faithful to rome i confess that i am skeptical both as a catholic and as an advocate for the religious freedom of all religious communities in china said farr who is president of the religious freedom institute earlier this year the vatican quite properly expressed grave concerns about chinas comprehensive anti religion policy and its apparent goal of altering catholicism itself this apparent concession to a communist government that is already forcing fundamental alterations of catholic doctrine and witness seems to me at least untimely and risky farr said farr likened the deal to the vaticans failed cold war realpolitik diplomacy of the s which failed from a want of realism about the evil of communism it harmed the church in parts of eastern europe he said the post war vatican was not then and is not now a secular power capable of changing the behavior of communist governments by dint of its political diplomacy the deal is especially damaging he continued because it represents an abdication of the vaticans unique role in world politics since the vatican is arguably the only authority in the world constituted precisely to address the root causes of totalitarian evil the holy sees role should be now as it has been in the past to press for human rights and especially for religious freedom for all religious communities in china he said dr farr is not alone in seeing a minefield of problems in the new vatican china deal johnnie moore a member of the us commission for international religious freedom uscirf told catholic news agency cna that many people outside of the catholic community are entirely confused by the timing and why the holy father agreed to  for all intents and purposes  demote faithful persevering priests who had endured so much for so long surely pope francis could have found a way to have a meaningful relationship with the chinese appointed bishops without picking sides between his flock and those whove viciously opposed it for so long he said im also afraid that clever leaders in china will use this deal with the vatican to distract the world from their resurgent egregious mistreatment of other religious communities as breitbart news reported last month cardinal joseph zen the bishop emeritus of hong kong has opposed the deal from the outset expressing his conviction that pope francis is really nave and doesnt know the chinese communists zen went so far as to call for the resignation of vatican secretary of state pietro parolin saying the accord he was brokering with the chinese communist party amounted to an incredible betrayal of the catholic faith in an interview with reuters zen described cardinal parolin as a secular bureaucrat with little time for martyrs and saints i dont think he has faith he is just a good diplomat in a very secular mundane meaning zen said he should resign zen has been a vocal critic of the ongoing negotiations and the vaticans apparent willingness to bow to demands of chinese president xi jinping who has tightened controls over all religious practice in china for decades faithful members of the underground catholic church in china have suffered persecution and even martyrdom in order to stay true to rome and now rome seems prepared to betray them the cardinal has stated the consequences will be tragic and long lasting not only for the church in china but for the whole church because it damages the credibility maybe thats why they might keep the agreement secret zen said the pope has tried to assuage the fears of chinese catholics and others concerned about the concession of too much authority to the communist party in the internal affairs of the church and wrote a letter to chinas catholics dated september  saying that he understood their worries but urged them to trust him francis said he is convinced that encounter can be authentic and fruitful only if it occurs through the practice of dialogue which involves coming to know one another to respect one another and to walk together for the sake of building a common future of sublime harmony in the provisional agreement he said the holy see has desired only to attain the churchs specific spiritual and pastoral aims namely to support and advance the preaching of the gospel and to reestablish and preserve the full and visible unity of the catholic community in china follow thomas d williams on twitter follow tdwilliamsrome

thousands of documents pertaining to former vice president joe bidens  year career in the us senate are unlikely to become public until after the  election on friday the washington post reported that a collection of documents biden donated to the university of delaware will not be made accessible until december  or two years after the former vice president retires from public life when the documents were initially donated in  the university agreed to keep them sealed for two years after biden retires from public office those parameters appear to have changed on  april the day before biden declared his presidential run the university announced the trove of documents would not be made public until two years after biden retires from public life or after dec   whichever comes later the university has provided no definition for what is considered public life according to the post the entire collection is unavailable andrea boyle tippett a spokeswoman for the university said its contents will become available when mr biden retires from public life as he is currently running for office he is in public life tippett added since retirement for anyone not just public figures takes different forms i cant speculate beyond that it appears unclear to what extent bidens team is involved in the changing deadline the biden campaign said no change has been made to the agreement since september  although it could not say what change was made then the post reported the campaign said it had nothing to do with the change announced by the university in april the documents which purportedly fill  boxes and include  gigabytes of electronic records span the length of bidens tenure in the us senate from  through  included within the trove of documents are committee reports drafts of legislation and personal correspondance between biden and his colleagues portions of the documents are likely to be controversial especially those detailing bidens work with segregationists to oppose the use of busing integrate public schools in the s in recent weeks the former vice president has been under fire after praising the civility of two of his allies in that fight the late segregationist sens james eastland d ms and herman talmadge d ga the issue came to a head at the democrat presidential debate last month when sen kamala harris d ca confronted biden over the remarks and his longstanding views on busing i agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground harris said but i also believe and its personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing she continued there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day that little girl was me so i will tell you that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate we have to take it seriously biden attempted to defend himself but instead of disputing the claims the former vice president only muddled his position on busing and inaccurately claimed that he never offered praise for racists apart from bidens own mishandling of the situation the controversy has also refused to die down because of a constant stream of old statements and positions coming to light other portions of bidens career such as those dealing with clarence thomass confirmation to the supreme court and his authoring of the  crime bill are likely to be controversial as well david brinkely a noted historian and presidential biographer told the post it would not be surprising if bidens team had sought to delay the release of the documents they arent keen on opening a lot of information when someone is running for office brinkley said i wish they were wide open for the public but alas when politicians start running for the president they try to make sure theres not that kind of transparency or documentation the biden papers will be a great boon for scholars of american political history in the th and st century he added there will be notes on anita hill segregation busing and on and on    just seeing what the incoming was into his office and seeing copies of letters biden wrote in response  itll be a rich trove please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

on fridays pbs newshour new york times columnist david brooks said that whether or not to reopen schools should be decided at the local level by people who know what theyre talking about and that while reopening schools can be done in some places having an all or nothing and forcing schools to do stuff by floating the possibility of withholding their federal funding if they dont reopen like president trump has done strikes me as insane brooks stated donald trump is out of touch opening the schools strikes me as the classic problem that should a be settled in some sort of subtle way by people who know what theyre talking about and maybe in some places you can open the schools and maybe you cant politics is about competing goods and competing goods are getting kids educated getting parents some relief and keeping them safe and so it should be possible in local areas in new york maybe where the disease is not so good  or is not so high to strike some sort of workable way to do this but having an all or nothing and forcing schools to do stuff strikes me as insane follow ian hanchett on twitter ianhanchett please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

sign up for our newsletter the election is not about ideology not about issues its about insurgency noted democrat pollster pat caddell told breitbart news network editor in chief alexander marlow appearing on the sunday edition of breitbarts radio show on sirius xm  the patriot channel caddell gave his take on the state of the presidential race sign up for our newsletter with voting set to begin with the iowa caucuses next week caddells take is a must listen for those closely following the nomination contest in both parties a veteran of presidential campaigns stretching over four decades caddell has had a front row seat at many political defining moments in recent history for caddell the  election is about voters revolting against washington and the political classes that have dominated government and policy in recent years the system is on the verge of coming apart caddell noted the politicians in washington arent going to be able to put the genie back in the bottle most republican campaigns have been left flat footed in response according to caddell he places the blame squarely on republican party consultants coming out of dc and the republican national committee misunderstanding the mood of voters they have less feel for the electorate than the man in the moon caddell observed caddell noted that the only two republican candidates who have not hired or surrounded themselves with national republican consultants are donald trump and ted cruz scott walker he said surrounded himself with consultants out of washington and out of the rnc and they immediately destroyed his candidacy the remaining candidates he said have listened to their consultants and have relied on out dated messaging and strategies and have spent millions of dollars to no appreciable effect mike murphy has spent millions taking jeb bush from  percent in the polls to  percent caddell said the same sclerosis is plaguing marco rubios campaign according to caddell although rubio has done very well in the debates caddell said his campaign doesnt move he attributes this to the fact that rubios campaign is run by the romney people rubio is unwilling to run as an outsider caddell observed rubios campaign seems to be focused on presenting the florida senator as the most conservative member of the political establishment if as caddell thinks the election is about an insurgency rather than ideology rubios strategy is doubly wrong caddell also said that he was surprised rubio hasnt used electability as a cornerstone of his campaign more than half of republican voters are angry at their political leadership caddell noted but they also want to win in november the growing animosity between donald trump and ted cruz and the very negative tone of their campaigns against each other does provide an opening for a third candidate to surprise in iowa or new hampshire caddell said it is unclear who that could be though since the other candidates seem to be running to coming in third or fourth as their focus when you run for president caddell said you have to run to win not finish in a certain spot although trump and cruz are dominating republican polling he sees possible dangers for both campaigns caddell believes cruz is making a mistake running more as a conservative ideologue than an insurgent outsider he believes cruz is tied to a political myth that the reagan landslide victory in  was a conservative wave election caddell believes that election was more of a revolt by voters against a terrible economy and the hostage situation in iran than an embrace of conservative ideology the danger for trump is more subtle the establishments hatred of cruz and the recognition that trump is at heart a deal maker have caused many old republican establishment hands to embrace trump recently last week bob dole said he would prefer trump over cruz for the nomination iowa gov terry branstad who is the longest serving governor in the country and has never been involved publicly in the iowa presidential caucuses came out strongly last week against cruz specifically over the candidates opposition to ethanol and wind power mandates and subsidies caddell said branstads comments against cruz were a little disingenuous since the governors son works for the ethanol lobby in the state trump caddell said has been a little to quick to welcome the outreach from the political establishment caddell said the iowa caucuses which take place february  will be decided by turnout in the last two elections caddell said republican turnout in the caucuses has been around  voters caddell said trump and cruz are essentially tied among voters who have caucused in the past if turnout goes up appreciably though caddell believes trump could win turnout is also a factor in the democrat race caddell said traditionally around  democrats have turned out for the caucuses if that number gets closer to or about  like it did for obama in  then sanders is likely to win caddell noted that sanders appeal to young voters is enormous he said among voters under  sanders is beating clinton by something close to a   margin the campaign so far has shown that clinton will lie about anything caddell said it is wearing thin caddell thinks massachusetts sen elizabeth warren may have missed her moment by declining to run he thinks sanders great advantage right now is his authenticity sanders is also helped by the fact that young voters dont know what socialism is caddell said and they wont he added until hes the nominee sanders is resonating because hes talking about the political and financial system being rigged trump resonates because he says this same system is broken or incompetent trump and sanders are drinking from different ends of the same trough caddell said revolts arent always pretty but they are the lifeblood of a republic listen to the interview comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit

china published a white paper thursday on the human rights situation in western xinjiang province where beijing has established dozens of internment camps for members of the uighur muslim minority the white paper titled cultural protection and development in xinjiang follows a week of mounting pressure on the chinese government to admit to interning an estimated million uighurs and other ethnic minorities in these camps and forcing them to praise the communist party and learn mandarin a language barely spoken in the province chinas state council argues in the paper that the ethnic and religious minorities present in xinjiang have the full freedom to exist as long as they follow the guidance of the communist party and learn mandarin the paper does not address the internment camps the government has worked to modernize ethnic cultures to strengthen cultural exchanges with foreign countries and to enhance each groups cultural confidence while engaging in exchanges with and mutual learning from others the white paper declares it goes on to argue that chinese  referring to mandarin the most common language among the han ethnic majority  has been present in xinjiang since ancient times and that ethnic people are enthusiastic about learning and using standard chinese to adapt to economic and social development and increased communication the paper never refers to the language as mandarin but rather chinese or putonghua which roughly translates into common tongue while putonghua often encompasses mandarin as well as other less common dialects they are all mutually intelligible rather than distinct languages like cantonese or uighur it regularly mentions the uighur minority as one of a variety of identities in xinjiang and suggests that the forced learning of mandarin over native languages has helped develop xinjiangs ethnic cultures and helps different ethnic groups to communicate develop and progress on the issue of religion the chinese government white paper makes the case that through strictly regulating religious documents translations and rituals the communist party is making religious people in xinjiang freer xinjiang upholds the tradition of religious localization and provides guidance to religions on adaptation to chinas socialist system the paper suggests adding religious circles in xinjiang are encouraged to promote social harmony and development as well as cultural progress with the aid of religious doctrines and rules and elaborate on the doctrines and rules that contribute to chinas development and conform to chinas traditions the chinese state run newspaper global times argued on thursday that the white paper was necessary in light of ongoing western accusations against human rights citing chinese government mouthpieces who dismiss human rights concerns among the uighur minority as complete nonsense china has dealt with more international action this week against its suppression of the uighurs as reports mount detailing the thousands forcibly taken from their homes to internment camps  the conclusion of years of policies under communist party leader xi jinping to eradicate both islam generally and uighur culture specifically from xinjiang on wednesday lawmakers in the us congress introduced legislation to sanction chinese communist party officials including the senior administrator in xinjiang over the development of the camps a day later reuters reported that a coalition of  ambassadors from western nations issued a letter to beijing demanding they be allowed to observe the camps which china describes as vocational centers and confirm that the governments claims that no human rights abuses occur there are accurate chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying responded to the letter with outrage calling the envoys behavior very rude and unacceptable and saying to reporters i dont know why you chose to publish this kind of story do you think that it is meaningful for  ambassadors

on friday the labor department reported that the economy gained just k jobs in may far below economists expectations worse the feds revised estimates of job gains in the previous two months down wiping k jobs off the labor rolls the unemployment rate fell however to  percent as thousands of frustrated workers left the labor force the may jobs report which was worse than the most pessimistic predictions put many economic observers in a dark mood  at least until the next jobs report in about four weeks the ups and downs of the monthly jobs report while important for the markets and architects of federal reserve policy obscure a more fundamental shift in the labor force since obama took office higher paying manufacturing jobs are shrinking relative to the economy while jobs in health care retail trade and hospitality are growing quickly when obama took office in  manufacturing jobs were the biggest component of the private sector job market in january  almost  million americans worked in jobs that built bolted or dug things out of the ground the recession was nearing its worst but almost  percent of all private jobs were engaged in manufacturing or building things today just  million americans have jobs in this sector significantly lower than  even as the overall private job market has expanded by  million or seven percent just over  percent of all private sector jobs are now engaged in the value added work of making things at the same time jobs in health care education and social services have exploded when obama took office just over  million americans worked in this sector today almost  million do the health care sector has grown from  percent of all private jobs to  percent for the first time in our nations history employment in health care and education is greater than manufacturing we are less a country that builds things and more a country that bandages up people professional and business services have also displaced manufacturing in the jobs pecking order in  private sector service jobs were the third biggest component of the job market employing around  percent of the labor force today the sector employs  percent of all private sector workers in january  the top three sectors for jobs were manufacturing healthcare and business services today it is health care business services and manufacturing retail and hospitalities jobs also exploded over the last seven years while financial services and information technology declined the information and technology revolution may get a lot of press but it doesnt create a lot of jobs in   million americans were employed in this sector but only  million work in it today the shift in the make up of the workforce isnt simply an interesting anthropological development average pay in the manufacturing sector is higher than the national average and much higher than the health care sector the average weekly pay of a manufacturing worker is almost  percent higher than a worker in health care health care workers earn about five percent less than average private sector workers workers in the hospitality sector though earn about  percent less while those in retail earn about  percent less if manufacturing and health care workers were employed at the same levels they were when obama took office there would be more than two million more factory workers and almost three million fewer health care workers the increase in overall personal income would be significant one way to measure the economy is by the sum total of jobs if people arent working they dont have the money they need to live consume and better their lives the types of jobs they have and the pay that goes with those jobs is also important though since obama took office retail and hospitality have added  million jobs while manufacturing has shrunk by k manufacturing was the number one sector for private jobs in  today it is the third biggest sector a great deal of the stagnant economy for the last seven years can be explained by that single fact please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
twitter temporarily locked philippines foreign affairs secretary teodoro locsin jr out of his account after he replied to a leftist critic by posting these are fucking communists you shoot them you dont listen to them locsin posted the remark on march  by monday morning manila time he appeared to have regained posting power telling the activist whose report resulted in his suspension to lighten up locsin is the philippines top diplomat responsible for representing the administration of president rodrigo duterte to the world he is extremely active on twitter and like his boss does not shy away from profanity or off color remarks while vocally condemning communism in theory locsin supports dutertes pro china policies and once apologized to the chinese communist party for accurately condemning mass murderer mao zedong for unleashing a famine during his dictatorship loscin ran afoul of twitters anti violent threat rules in response to an article quoting renato reyes jr secretary general of the leftist group bayan country objecting to the presence of us troops in the country the philippines and the united states have a historic military alliance and regularly schedule military exercises though duterte has routinely questioned the wisdom of cooperating with america and threatened to form alliances with china and russia despite the seeming space for agreement between locsin and bayan locsin reposted a link to a philippine inquirer article about bayan with his advice to shoot communists while a url still exists for the tweet it leads to a page reading only this tweet is no longer available because it violated the twitter rules on locsins timeline the tweet no longer appears where it would have chronologically between a statement on his steadfast commitment to asean the association of southeast asian nations and a joke about how all characters in the old testament had beards including the women reyes the head of the bayan group confirmed on monday that he had reported the post in question and as a result twitter had temporarily prevented locsin from posting on the site the philippine news broadcaster abs cbn noted that twitter did not independently say that the shoot communists tweet caused the suspension we welcome this action by twitter for so long locsin thought he could get away with anything but when he threatens harm on activists who are merely expressing their views we will have to draw the line and fight back reyes said in a post on social media confirming the suspension he is abusive and appalling we look forward to his return to twitter and perhaps by then he will learn some humility and tolerance in dealing with opinions that are different from his locsin returned to twitter a few hours later apparently telling reyes to lighten up my friend see that smile lighten up my friend httpstcoxhjpsxgr  teddy locsin jr teddyboylocsin march   reyes replied welcoming locsin back adding we hope he starts treating with respect those who hold different views stop wishing that they be shot locsin kept the conversation going by alluding to the horrors of soviet gulags absolutely comrade sometimes i get this vision of a cell in lubyanka where the floor slopes like a funnel to a drain my best american friend was in lubyanka he gave me a most vivid account of life under communism httpstcoxlwssyy  teddy locsin jr teddyboylocsin march   salvador panelo dutertes spokesman defended locsin as a diplomat on monday comparing him to duterte himself hes a responsible government official and effective in his job go beyond the language look at the meat and the essence and the substance of what hes saying urged reporters at his monday press briefing maybe thats just hyperbole it looks like the presidents style thats just hyperbole the incident is not the first in which locsins colorful language on communism resulted in controversy in october in response to panelo answering a bizarre dare to commute to work on public transportation locsin tweeted it was a giant win for sal panelo because he answered the challenge and pulled it off and that was the point right of course it is unless youre a fucking communist then the only point is to take power and unleash a famine like mao did locsin then added in defense of panelo low class bitches wont access that he won that one locsin also referred derogatorily to mao as tutung a philippine word for burnt rice he issued a groveling apology to china shortly thereafter he did not make clear if it was an honest or sarcastic one my profound apologies to the peoples republic of china the communist party responsible for its unprecedented achievements and amb zhao for using the great helmsmans name in vain all this revisionism makes meas the first defender of red chinaforget my admiration a month after this dispute locsin attacked a philippine inquirer journalist for reporting on dutertes absence at asean conference meetings in several tweets he referred to journalist jhesset enano as you shet sic and asked uh did you get the putangina son of a whore i sent you when enano replied with the text of public servant laws that require locsin to behave with professionalism he replied fuck you locsin later deleted the tweet duterte similarly resorts to profanity against political opponents often and has attacked communists as rotten thats what i am telling communists you have jeopardized caused sorrow and misery to the country fighting for a lost cause the communist ideology is over its over and done with he said in remarks in january  a year before that condemnation duterte publicly ordered philippine soldiers to shoot communist women tell the soldiers theres a new order coming from the mayor we wont kill you we will just shoot your

comedy scriptwriter graham linehan  co creator of father ted  has been given a verbal harassment warning by police after deadnaming a transgender activist on twitter the guardian reports linehan was told by west yorkshire police not to contact the activist stephanie hayden after a row on twitter hayden reported him for transphobia after he referred to her as he and for deadnaming her by referring to her by names used before she transitioned the pair had been involved in a dispute on twitter about gender identity resulting in the writer retweeting a post to his  followers that gave haydens previous names with pictures the irony here is exquisite beyond measure for linehan to fall foul of the identity politics mob is a bit like stalin being done for showing insufficient socialist zeal or genghis khan being criticised for taking a kid gloves approach to rape and murder almost no celebrity on twitter has enforced the values of identity politics social justice and political correctness more rigorously implacably and indeed unpleasantly than graham linehan but now in the form of stephanie hayden  a transgender activist formerly known as tony and steven  linehan has finally met his match what i cant quite decide is whether to gloat or come out hard in linehans defence on the gloating side linehan really has behaved like a very nasty piece of work over the years in my case for example he refers to me as gollum based on a single picture taken of me when i was particularly emaciated with my lyme disease whereas all the other pictures ever taken of me show that i am radiantly gorgeous and once helped promote an unpleasant rumour about me and dogs hes also the most terrible bully more than happy to punch down from his millionaire celebrity eyrie at anyone who dares disagree with him in  charlie nash recounted at breitbart how linehan had ridiculed and posted a private picture of a  year old student as punishment for being  in linehans view  on the wrong side of gamergate so in many ways we should all be rejoicing at linehans comeuppance  except for one detail in this particular instance he is on the right side of the argument linehan is properly concerned about the excesses of the more extreme members of the transgender movement he doesnt agree for example with the radicals who say that transgenderism should merely be a process of self identification ie if you say youre a woman you should be treated as such regardless of whether youve had your bits cut off according to the guardian linehan highlighted a petition he had signed calling on stonewall an lgbt charity to acknowledge the conflict that exists between transgenderism and sex based womens rights the petition calls for a respectful debate on the issue and contends that stonewall is failing to recognise the diversity of viewpoints on transgender issues including among lgbt people linehan had given his backing to a support group of trans women who are opposed to self identification and said he would back their campaign on social media in other words what linehan has somewhat belatedly realised is that identity politics is a race to the bottom its a game in which professional victims compete to see who can demonstrate themselves to be the most oppressed groupuscule invariably the winners in this game are the people who are the most batshit crazy and for years linehan has been one of the celebrity worlds useful idiots  the wankerati as i call them  who has done most to stoke this bonfire of insanity we are living in revolutionary times  not as bloody yet as the latter stages of the french revolution or as stalins terror but driven by the same destructive urge to make the world anew by rejecting all the logic the hierarchy the traditions the commonsense that have gone before what invariably happens in these revolutions is that the robespierres and the zinovievs  the people who imagined that their revolutionary zeal would protect them  end up on the guillotine or before the execution squad just as surely as all the class enemies theyve been persecuting perhaps this will be a wake up call to linehan  and to sjw celebrities like linehan but somehow i doubt it please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

professional atheist richard dawkins continues to push the envelope against a god deluded world proposing that cultivating and eating human meat might help society overcome its taboo against cannibalism commenting on an article from the uks independent newspaper which touts the benefits of lab grown clean meat dawkins tweeted earlier this month that perhaps something similar could be done with human flesh which would assist western culture in shedding yet another irrational remnant of its judeo christian roots dawkins said that eating lab grown human meat would provide an interesting test case for consequentialist morality versus yuck reaction absolutism which keeps people from doing things just because they seem morally repugnant tissue culture clean meat already in  ive long been looking forward to this httpstcopnrnezn what if human meat is grown could we overcome our taboo against cannibalism an interesting test case for consequentialist morality versus yuck reaction absolutism  richard dawkins richarddawkins march   the independent article cites josh tetrick the ceo of clean meat manufacturer just who claims that clean meatmade from stem cells harvested from living livestock and then grown in a labcould be on restaurant menus by the end of the year familiar meat products such as chicken nuggets sausage and even foie gras will be manufactured using the process and could be served in restaurants in the us and asia before the end of  tetrick said richard dawkins suggests taking the procedure a step further and producing human meat which presumably would also come from stem cells as an absolute materialist who denies the existence of anything that cannot be measured by science dawkins is a moral pragmatist there is no soul or afterlife in the dawkins world so morality is defined by the here and now and the value of human actions is judged solely by their effects whether dawkinss brave new world  where every taboo is bulldozed and nothing is forbidden  would make people happier better or more fulfilled is far from self evident for now dinner guests in the dawkins home would be well advised to choose a seat near the door in case their host decides to change up the menu follow thomas d williams on twitter follow tdwilliamsrome please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

sign up for our newsletter failed  republican nominee mitt romney is lobbying to be picked as donald trumps secretary of state so perhaps trumps team should review all of romneys undiplomatic statements from  and  about the future commander in chief  romney indicated last june he would never serve in a trump administration when talking to attendees at his experts and enthusiasts summit or e meeting in utah the meeting took place at the resort where romney announced his  campaign for the presidency according to the washington post had there been a president bush or a president marco rubio or a president scott walker i mightve been happy to be a part of their administration romney told hundreds of his donors and business partners according to cnn sign up for our newsletter  romneys infamous march  trump bashing speech at the university of utah included a stream of vehement nevertrump commentary let me put it plainly if we republicans choose donald trump as our nominee the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished  he inherited his business he didnt create it  a business genius he is not  what he said on  minutes about syria and isis has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the campaign season let isis take out assad he said and then we can pick up the remnants  im afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very very not smart  dishonesty is donald trumps hallmark  his is not the temperament of a stable thoughtful leader his imagination must not be married to real power  think of donald trumps personal qualities the bullying the greed the showing off the misogyny the absurd third grade theatrics we have long referred to him as the donald he is the only person in america to whom we have added an article before his name it wasnt because he had attributes we admired  a trump nomination enables hillary clintons victory  i predict that there are more bombshells in his tax returns i predict that he doesnt give much if anything to the disabled and to our veterans i predict that he told the new york times that his immigration talk is just that talkif im right you will have all the proof you need to know that donald trump is a phony  mr trump is directing our anger for less than noble purposes  heres what i know donald trump is a phony a fraud his promises are as worthless as a degree from trump university hes playing the american public for suckers he gets a free ride to the white house and all we get is a lousy hat his domestic policies would lead to recession his foreign policies would make america and the world less safe he has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president and his personal qualities would mean that america would cease to be a shining city on a hill  romney and other nevertrumpers attempted to recruit a third party challenger to trump when asked at the american friends of the hebrew university awards ceremony on may  if he would run as an independent in the presidential race according to the washington examiner romney replied no im certainly going to be hoping that we find someone who i have my confidence in who becomes nominee i dont intend on supporting either of the major party candidates at this point  cnn noted in june that romney had not ruled out voting for libertarian party candidate gary johnson and that if bill weld had been at the top of the ticket it would be very easy for me to vote for bill weld for president  on location at romneys e summit in june which hosted many nevertrumpers he gave an exclusive interview to cnns wolf blitzer wolf blitzer you dont believe he can change romney i believe he can hide who he is but i believe who he is has been revealed by his lifetime and by the words in the campaign that he has spoken to this point  i dont think theres anything im looking for from mr trump to give him my support hes demonstrated who he is and ive decided that a person of that nature should not be the one who um if you will becomes the example for coming generations or the example of america to the world  look i dont want to see trickle down racism i dont want to see a president of the united states saying things which change the character of the generations of americans that are following  trickle down racism trickle down bigotry trickle down misogyny all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of america and and and so im not im not looking for mr trump to change a policy that more aligns with my own this is not a matter of just policy its more a matter of character and integrity  i think his comments time and again appeal to the racist tendency that exists in some people and i think thats very dangerous  the atlantic listed romney as one of the remaining nays among the nevertrump crowd as of nov  two days before trump won his landslide victory in june romney told blitzer that he would write in the name or a republican other than trump in the general election and confirmed he would not vote for clinton  romney explained his strong convictions against trump despite the chance that hillary clinton would be elected president in a may interview with the wall street journal i wanted my grandkids to see that i simply couldnt ignore what mr trump was saying and doing which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world  others including myself believe our first priority should be to stand by our principles and if those are in conflict with the nominee the principles come first  when the grandkids ask what did you do to stop donald trump what are you going to say  in a march  facebook post romney wrote trumpism has become associated with racism misogyny bigotry xenophobia vulgarity and most recently threats and violence i am repulsed by each and every one of these  romney became the de facto leader of the movement to deprive trump of the republican nominationbranded online as nevertrump following the march  facebook post according to the new yorker  romney told fox business host neil cavuto following the march anti trump speech ill either vote for a conservative who runs or ill write in the name of a conservative i cannot in good conscience vote for a person who has been as degrading disruptive and unhinged as ive seen donald trump be  romney did not attend the july  republican national convention in cleveland ohio where trump officially became the republican partys nominee for president of the united states bob dole was the only former republican party presidential nominee to attend the  convention  rick wilson spokesman for independent presidential candidate evan mcmullin told the washington examiner in october that the mcmullin campaign used an

former house speaker newt gingrich tells breitbart news that he would consider being republican candidate donald trumps running mate in novembers general election asked if trump has asked him to be running mate gingrich said no asked if he would consider being running mate gingrich said yes but i think he has to make that decision it is the most extraordinary campaign of its time the former speaker added hes come out of nowhere and defeated  other candidates if he catches fire he could be much like reagan in  gingrich said noting that trump could match those record numbers if this thing continues to evolve and people learn how dishonest and unserious hillary clinton is in conversation gingrich habitually rattles off ballot statistics for small nationalistic parties in other parts of the world from austria where the election is so close theyre going to have to re run it because the establishment stole about  votes the two parties that had run the country came in fourth and fifth to rome where virginia raggi won the mayoral election heading the populist five star movement to great britain the british people heard from the establishment unanimously opposing it and the people just ignored them and rolled over it he said before he started talking about the election of a schoolteacher in iceland i think the clintons are very very hardworking gingrich said they have an entire strategy of methodically lying and being surrounded by lawyers so it all works out does gingrich still have the clout to whip votes on capitol hill i have a very broad range of contacts and friendships he says but ill do that whether im vice president or not years of calling gingrich the former house speaker as his title in articles is somewhat anachronistic he has been for a republican generation that elected virtually the entire  presidential field more like washingtons most active citizen attendee of government ethics and reform hearings he can be seen on the hill sometimes doing things like blocking new section  regulations on obamacare by the department of health and human services he also runs a media production company on the virginia side of the key bridge breitbart news grilled gingrich winner of the  south carolina primary and loser to mitt romney in the more important florida primary about his debate assertion that the united states needs a more humane deportation policy what does he think about trump on immigration walls work ive always been for the wall ive always believed youve had to have fencing we have the right to control who comes into the united states my only point was were not going to have forced deportations in great numbers of law abiding illegals who are already in the country trump knows that what he is proposing is similar to something kay bailey hutchinson proposed that some illegal aliens can go home register and come back legally i think that is sustainable when gingrich introduced trump at his rally this week in ohio people chanted newt for vice president drawing a reaction from trump when gingrich started running long in his opening remarks people to the right of the stage yelled trump your governor whos a good friend of mine but its about time he got on the trump bandwagon gingrich said to applause this guy is going to kick over the table gingrich said so i want you to give a great ohio welcome to the next president of the united states donald trump comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page
the number of foreigners getting green cards and legal resident status in the united states dropped by just  percent from  to  according to data released january  by the department of homeland security the small but useful decline from  million in  down to  million in  means that for every  green cards handed out in  just  green cards were handed out in  this drop reduces the flood of new workers to employers and it nudges down housing pressure and school overcrowding but the inflow is still huge it amounts to two legal immigrants for every seven american births in  mothers gave birth to  million americans the improvement is denounced by business investors who want the federal government to import many more workers consumers and real estate customers the migrant inflow helps to pump up their sales profits and stock values the percentage drop in green cards from  to  is actually  percent once the simultaneous decline in new refugees is counted complained stuart anderson a pro migration advocate who writes for forbescom the latest statistics show efforts by administration officials to reduce legal immigration have from their perspective started to bear fruit favorable court rulings and another four years in power would mean even lower levels of legal immigration to the united states and fewer us citizens allowed to have their spouses parents and children come live with them in america president donald trumps policies did sharply reduce the inflow of migrants from muslim cultures anderson said the presidential proclamation issuing the travel ban against five majority muslim nations  iran libya somalia syria and yemen with certain restrictions added for venezuela and north korea  reduced immigration from those five countries by  or  between fy  and fy  excluding refugees and asylees approved in earlier years the number of legal immigrants excluding refugees and asylees admitted from yemen declined from  in fy  to  in fy  while legal immigration from iran dropped from  in fy  to  in fy  however trumps policies have not reduced significantly the inflow of foreign college graduate workers into the united states via the visa worker programs these include the h b l  optional practical training programs and green card sponsorship programs overall roughly  million foreign college graduate workers hold jobs in the united states including at least  who are working while waiting for green cards the imported workers are intended to suppress salaries earned by american professionals trumps statements about foreign workers show him zig zagging between his voters and his donors we have to allow smart people to stay in our country  if you graduate number one in your class at harvard if you graduate from the wharton school of finance trump told radio host laura ingraham on january  if we tell smart people to get the hell out thats not america first ingraham reminded trump of the disney h b scandal in  where hundreds of americans were replaced by h b workers you ran on people training their foreign replacements that you ran against that its humiliating for an american worker who works for a company for  years  to train your replacement ingraham said no no thats different i would never do that said trump why shouldnt we have american graduates of colleges and universities taking those jobs ingraham said donald trump told ingraham that ceos want only a small no of extraordinary foreign graduates but fedl data shows that ceos  wall st flood white collar labor markets with a huge inflow of ordinary foreign it healthcare finance etc grads shttpstcosfruqruac  neil munro neilmunrodc january   the dhs data does not show the number of foreign workers who are working in the united states it only provides the number of foreign workers admissions this admission number overcounts the actual number of foreign workers because many leave and return multiple times each year the agencies refuse to provide any data on the resident number of foreign h b l  j  or e  workers but officials are recalculating the opt numbers to show a reduction from  to  data provided to breitbart news by the dhs shows universities provided  opt work permits in  supposedly down from  work permits in  this revised  total consisted of  migrants with one year opt work permits and  migrants with three year opt stem work permits the inflow of opt workers would likely skyrocket if sen mike lee r utah passes his s bill the legislation would allow an unlimited number of foreign temporary migrants to get permanently renewable work permits once they can persuade  or pay  their us employer to nominate them for a green card this early adjustment rule would allow a huge number of foreign college graduates to permanently live and work in the united states even without receiving green cards other data shows that more than at least  million foreigners got employment authorization documents in  to work in the united states including a few hundred thousand migrants from central america these migrants tend to reduce wages for blue collar americans also both democrats and republicans in congress are blocking efforts to deport more of the resident population of illegal immigrants that population includes at least  million consumers and eight million workers the award of green cards is a different process from the subsequent award of citizenship via naturalization naturalization rates have remained stable at  naturalizations in  and  naturalizations in  according to the dhs data another poll showing the obvious the  of americans who want less legal immigration is x than  who want more migration whites blacks  hispanics share similar support for lower migration leaving liberals  high income as the strongest

sign up for our newsletter its not only illegal aliens who are escaping enforcement of the nations immigration laws under the obama administrations expansive interpretation of executive authority legal immigrants seeking citizenship through the nations naturalization process are now exempt from a key part of the oath of allegiance immigrants seeking to become citizens no longer have to pledge to bear arms on behalf of the united states they can opt out of that part of the oath nor do they have to cite any specific religious belief that forbids them to perform military service according to the naturalization fact sheet on the us citizenship and immigration service uscis website in the fiscal year ending june   the nation welcomed  legal permanent residents into full citizenship   over the past decade  million have been naturalized through a process that ends with the oath of allegiance   in the decade   the average number completing naturalization was only  annually but from  to  that number jumped to over  annually    new citizens were welcomed in the year     million immigrants are eligible to eventually become citizens and  million already meet the  year residency requirement the pledge to help defend america was good enough for the  million immigrants naturalized since  and good enough for the over  million naturalized since  but obamas appointees at the uscis think that is too much to ask of the  million estimated legal immigrants eligible today for eventual naturalization or the  who will be naturalized in the coming year this radical change was announced a year ago in july of  congress did not enact the change in new legislation there was no congressional debate no filibuster in the us senate and no sit in in the house to demand that a bill to repeal the uscis action be brought to a vote no this radical change was implemented while congress slept like other obama actions to undermine our immigration laws the republican controlled congress has not used its constitutional powers to reverse the administrative action thank god many states are stepping up to fill that void this week the us supreme court let stand a federal district court ruling invalidating obamas unconstitutional dapa amnesty by a   tie vote the supreme court declined to review the circuit courts ruling upholding the houston district court decision therefore it is now the law and obamas dapa amnesty is voided if justice scalia were still alive and participating in the case it would have been a   ruling because the swing vote associate justice kennedy voted with justices alito roberts and thomas where was congress why did it take a lawsuit by the governors and attorneys general of  states to overturn obamas unconstitutional actions its true that other presidents have made changes in the naturalization process by administrative decree and without congressional approval in  in the wake of the   terrorist attack president george bush by executive order expedited the naturalization process for  immigrants serving in the armed forces while many will agree with bushs action and even applaud that change should have been done by act of congress not a presidential executive order in fact most americans will think it extremely odd that the uscis action with regard to the oath of allegiance is not illegal but the fact is unelected bureaucrats at the uscis can change the wording of the oath without approval of the peoples representatives in congress strange as it sounds the law as it stands today allows uscis bureaucrats great leeway in managing the naturalization process so obamas actions will not be challenged in federal court yet in view of obamas actions why doesnt congress change the law and take control of the oath of allegiance so far there is no indication that the republican leadership will do so if they wont even bar islamic terrorists from the refugee program why should we expect them to protect the oath of allegiance some members of congress will grumble make speeches and issue press releases but the republican leadership will do nothing such is the state of the nation as we approach this th anniversary of the declaration of independence some americans see great irony in the british declaring their independence from the tyranny of brussels while americans quietly accept the new tyranny of washington dc comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

the two year budget plan announced wednesday by top senate leaders has caused an apparent split between sen minority sen chuck schumer and house minority leader rep nancy pelosi the plan sharply increases domestic spending by roughly  million over the next two years but it effectively blocks the democrats push to win a  amnesty for so called dreamer illegals the agreement blocks that amnesty push because it leaves the senate democrats without any budget leverage to force house speaker rep paul ryan to schedule an amnesty debate on the house floor that would split the gop caucus prior to the november election the amnesty defeat will be downplayed by democrats who believe they will gain support before november by mounting a large scale pr campaign for a dreamer amnesty the likely result of the campaign will be continued demands and protests for an amnesty but no significant votes  unless president donald trump caves on his four part amnesty and immigration plan pelosi spent several hours on wednesday morning theatrically complaining about the budget deal on the house floor she said it does nothing to even advance even with a commitment  without having passed the legislation first to advance bipartisan legislation to protect dreamers in this house without that commitment from speaker ryan comparable to the commitment from leader mcconnell this package does not have my support nor does it have the support of a large number of members of our caucus however pelosi does not have the votes to block the budget deal in the gop dominated house in his statement on the senate floor schumer echoed her complaint but only after touting the role played by endangered democratic senators in winning more spending for their states he ended his short speech by saying i also hope that speaker ryan will do what sen mcconnell has agreed to do  allow a fair and open process to debate a dreamer bill on the house floor both statements were aimed at the democratic base which has been ginned up to expect an amnesty battle and victory this year that base includes hundreds of illegal immigrants and protestors rallying wednesday at the capitol the two year budget deal is not the  government budget that budget has been blocked several times by fighting over the amnesty and spending levels  but the budget deal provides capitol hill appropriators will spending caps to guide set another six weeks to deft a final  spending plan to last the remainder of the year the appropriators have a new deadline of six weeks to devise a spending plan before house and senate votes in march and which will likely include funding for wall construction in  the two year budget offers an extra  billion for defense programs at at least  billion for vote winning domestic programs including  billion to counter the opioid epidemic schumer and his senate democrats gave up their push for amnesty leverage following their failed january government shutdown championed by the second ranking democrat sen dick durbin that unpopular shutdown damaged the reelection chances of  democratic senators who face the november voters in states won by president donald trump in  in exchange senate democrats won a promise from senate majority sen mitch mcconnell for a senate debate on amnesty starting february  mcconnell announced a few details of the planned debate at the end of his wednesday budget statement saying i obviously cannot guarantee any outcome let alone supermajority support i can ensure the process is fair to all sides and that is what i intend to do but that senate debate means little to democrats because ryan announced february  he would not allow a house debate on immgration unless president donald trump endorses the proposed amnesty and immigration bill ryan said tuesday let me be very clear about this well take a bill that the president supports so we look  put it this way president trump made a very serious and sincere offer of goodwill with the reforms that he sent to the hill that is what we should be working off of  so were not going to bring immigration legislation through that the president doesnt support ryans statement also blocks any senate amnesty bill because gop or democratic senators facing election in  will not vote for a unpopular amnesty if ryan has already declared their proposal will go nowhere without trumps approval if they vote for an amnesty opposed by trump they will not get a bill through the house and their vote will be hung around their necks during the  campaign season moreover without support from the roughly  democratic senators who face tough elections in november the democrats cant win support from ten to  business first gop senators who want to see a cheap labor amnesty approved by congress trumps own four part amnesty and immigration framework has been rejected by democrats because it gradually winds down the inflow of democratic leaning voters via chain migration program meanwhile trump and his chief of staff john kelly have shown frustration that the democrats have rejected what kelly described as a very generous amnesty and immigration offer since that rejection trumps language has begun shifting into a  campaign theme as he charges democrats with allowing an inflow of dangerous ms  gang members on february  for example trump said electing more republicans is one way to win pro american immigration reform really that is another way of doing it and based on the election related numbers we just saw we have a real chance of doing that  immigration is now an election issue that will go to our benefit not their benefit these changes suggest that trump  and perhaps some many republicans  will make immigration reform and amnesty a major part of the  election that focus is likely to help the gop candidates counter the huge number of progressives who are angry at their defeat by trump in  comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook

senate judiciary committee chairman sen lindsey graham r sc said sunday on cbss face the nation said he spoke to attorney general william barr who told him information coming out of ukraine could be russian propaganda graham said that included what president donald trumps attorney rudy giuliani was turning over to the justice department partial transcript as follows graham if rudy giuliani has any information coming out of the ukraine he needs to turn over the department of justice because it could be russian propaganda brennan you last time youre on this program now in december you said giuliani should come to the judiciary committee with what he said was a suitcase full of documents he picked up in ukraine on the bidens are you saying you dont want any part of this anymore graham after talking to the attorney general and the intelligence chairman that any documents coming out of the ukraine against any american republican or democrat need to be looked at by the intelligence services who has expertise i dont because russia is playing us all like a fiddle and christopher steele was played by the russians that started the russian investigation against president trump brennan right graham it was all garbage brennan are you saying rudy giuliani graham i dont want to do the same thing brennan rudy giuliani is getting played by the russians graham i dont know im saying that the attorney brennan well it sounds like thats what youre suggesting graham im saying that anybody whos got any information coming from the ukraine needs to turn it over to the intelligence community as to senator schumer warning parnas and the audience if you dont understand brennan this is one of rudy giulianis business associates graham yes crooked as snake brennan whos been indicted graham facing indictment so schiff gets called by russian hoaxster ive got photos of president trump in a compromised situation to every american politician you should be very cautious about receiving information coming out of the ukraine brennan right graham and other countries that may be backed by russian misinformation brennan does the president know that because he graham i hope so brennan apparently has continued to graham well if hes watching the show heres what i would tell the president brennan believe that ukraine had a role here graham im going to get to the bottom of the fisa work process because it was an abuse of power of the department of justice the fbi and were to make sure that hunter bidens conflict of interest is explored because its legitimate how could joe biden really fight corruption when his son sitting on the burisma board brennan can you clarify you said you talked to attorney general barr graham this morning brennan this morning has the department of justice been ordered to investigate the bidens graham no the department of justice is receiving information coming out of the ukraine from rudy brennan already graham to see he told me that theyve created a process that rudy could give information and they would see if its verified rudy giuliani is a well known man hes a crime fighter hes loyal to the president hes a good lawyer but what im trying to say  to the president and anybody else that the russians are still up to it deterrence is not working so lets look at hunter bidens conflict lets look at joe biden vice president biden what did you do when they told you your son was on burismas board it undercuts your ability to fight corruption did you take it seriously obviously he didnt but when it comes to documents coming out of the ukraine to republicans and democrats be very cautious turning brennan but the graham anything over you got over to the intel community brennan have you ever said to the president when he repeats things like the idea that theres the dnc server  server hidden in ukraine that this is russian propaganda that he is repeating and apparently believing graham well ill brennan have you ever said that directly to him graham well i dont have any information about the server being in the ukraine brennan but you just said graham it was the russians brennan things coming out of ukraine should be looked at with high scrutiny graham heres my point brennan because of russian interference graham my point it was the russians who hacked into the dnc not the ukrainians but there are people in the ukraine that were pulling against trump because they hated manafort to suggest there was no political interference coming out of the ukraine directed toward the president i think would be  would not withstand scrutiny brennan when  you have a role as chairman of senate judiciary to have oversight graham yeah brennan of justice department graham im not in charge of the whole government brennan but  i understand that however when youre talking about being asked to do these things in a channel being open between rudy giuliani and the justice department this sounds a lot like this is in some ways a taxpayer funded oppo research operation against joe biden isnt this exactly what was at the heart of the impeachment probe to begin with graham no not at all there are plenty of people being contacted by folks from the ukraine adam schiff got contacted by somebody thought to be a russian and he was willing to get on a plane apparently and go find the documents schumer believes that parnas has got the goods parnas says im in on it ive never met parnas so democrats are being played and im not going to be played so were going to look at the hunter biden joe biden connection to the ukraine were going to ask the state department why didnt you do something about the conflict of interest when the  john kerrys chief of staff was warned about hunter bidens conflict on burisma what did you do if anything thats all legitimate rudy says hes got the goods all i can tell rudy and anybody else if you got some information connected to the ukraine against anybody go to the intel committee not me

nbc news reporter kristen welker won high plaudits for her performance moderating last weeks final debate between president trump and former vice president joseph r biden for one thing she was the first moderator of this election cycle to ask a single question about illegal immigration  perhaps the biggest issue that got president trump elected in  though of vital concern to voters immigration is one of those issues that washington politicians in both parties along with the vast majority of the mainstream media pretend does not exist its a low bar but kudos to her ms welker even asked a passing question of mr biden about his sons highly shady dealings with china and ukraine in which the younger mr biden has acknowledged exploiting his fathers political position in the white house again a very low bar but if ms welker had opined about such matters on twitter or on her private facebook page she would have been censored silenced and shut down the nations oldest newspaper the new york post remains shut down by twitter over its insistence on reporting and publishing stories about hunter bidens shady business dealings so it was fairly remarkable for a card carrying washington journalist of good standing in the swamp to exhibit even the slightest degree of curiosity about the sordid situation ms welker isnt the only washington journalist lately to wander into the wilds of dangerous and inappropriate questions of presidential candidates just the week before another nbc journalist  morning personality savannah guthrie  asked mr trump during a televised town hall about a satanic pedophile ring that she insisted did not exist it is a conspiracy theory she said that people on the internet believe about a shadowy cabal of powerful people who are extremely influential at the highest levels of government in washington despite the murky origins of the story ms guthrie asked the president about it on live national television unlike illegal immigration this baffling theory seizes the imagination of washington journalists especially when mr trump retweets twitter messages posted by people who subscribe to the conspiracy theory known as qanon let me ask you about qanon ms guthrie said to mr trump it is this theory that democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are a savior of that now can you just once and for all state that that is completely not true and disavow qanon in its entirety she asked the president mr trump looked a little puzzled i know nothing about qanon he answered i just told you she replied you told me but just telling me doesnt necessarily make it fact i hate to say it he tried to let her down easy i do know they are very much against pedophilia they fight it very hard mr trump explained they believe it is a satanic cult run by the deep state mrs guthrie explained further mr trump insisted that he did not know what she was talking about and changed the subject to the antifa wing of the democratic party that has been rioting and burning cities in america of late unlike qanon the whole antifa thing isnt just some conspiracy theory that exists in the dark corners of the internet but ms guthrie was not interested in talking about real life events it is unclear what upsets journalists like savannah guthrie more that there is a theory that washington democrats are a cabal of powerful pedophiles flying around on big private jets to their private island hideaways or that according to this internet theory mr trump is the savior who has been elected to slay the deep state dragon please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

donald trump is two points ahead of hillary clinton in the critical state of pennsylvania according to a new poll from the trafalgar group trump is at  percent she is at  percent according to the poll from the little known polling firm which is also spotlighting evidence that trump has hidden support from an additional  percent to  percent of voters who dont want to reveal their true opinions breitbart news asked trafalgars ceo why readers should trust the firms predictions amid so many other polls that show trump lagging clinton by  percent in the critical state on wednesday im either going to be guy who got it right or nobody is going to listen to me any more responded company ceo robert cahaly thats why  and i take this craft seriously he told breitbart news in effect the company is betting its future by publicly testing  at its own expense  its own methods cahaly said his polls are designed to capture opinions from people who otherwise avoid lengthy interviews on the phone thats difficult under normal circumstances but it is especially difficult when many people are reluctant to pick a side in this hard fought election he keeps his questionnaires limited to a minute or two relies mostly on computer delivered phone questionnaires and he probes for hidden preferences by asking people who their neighbors are supporting that question about neighbors allows respondents to present their preferences as the opinion of others so minimizing possible fear of stigma or embarrassment for supporting trumpin pennsylvania the neighbors question boosts trumps score by  points up to  percent similarly clintons score drops from  percent down to  percent that shift converts a  point gap into a  point valley the poll was conducted nov  to nov  with  respondents the firm conducted similar polling in michigan on nov  where the panel of  respondents shows a  point trump lead  percent to  percent michigans neighbor question showed a  percent boost for trump giving him a  point advantage when quizzed by breitbart news about the reliability of a hidden vote cahaly offered several arguments for its existence his said his surveys during the primaries were unusually accurate and also revealed hidden support for trump he said the support was revealed when respondents were asked to respond to a computerized voice on the phone versus when talking to a live person we did live callers and push button telephone polls and we determined there was always a  point bounce for trump with computerized polls he said he says the people most likely to hide their votes are women and college educated professionals matching evidence from other polls whenever he asks the neighbors question the answers consistently show a hidden vote for trump worth three to nine points said cahaly the question never exposes hidden support for clinton which would appear if there is a bipartisan and equal reluctance to reveal voting preference in most political races the change is usually lower than  points and the candidate who is benefitting from the hidden vote goes up but the other candidate goes not go down he said in this  race clinton never gains points and also goes down when trump gains points he said i believe that is happening because the trump campaign is different from other campaigns  not just the candidate is being attacked his supporters are being attacked he said when is the last time in a presidential race when the candidates supporters are called deplorable racist ignorant this race is also different because so many voters are disgusted at washington and want to send a message regardless of the candidate he said theyre voting against the system they want to send a message  to the system that has done them wrong so the election is their middle finger he said many polls are inaccurate partly because many things change during a political campaign estimated turnout voting patterns and issues change from day to day the changes force pollsters to constantly tweak their polls during a campaign and the changes ensures that collections of polls can be way off from the final results the polling errors are also very different from state to state for example pollsters in  overestimated gop support in michigan but underestimated support in north carolina and florida reminder of where public polling error occurred in  coloradonevada but also michigan which always has public poll problems rcp data pictwittercomfofthehebe  nick gourevitch nickgourevitch november   there is some evidence that the publics willingness to openly declare support for trump has changed over time for example the huffington posts poll tracking site showed that trump did better early in the campaign with live caller polls but is now performing equally well with internet polls trafalgar is the target of much criticism from other pollsters for example for understating the likely african american and latino turnout in nevada in a race it predicts trump to win  percent to  percent that poll was conduct nov  to nov  stevesingiser trafalgar  white  latino  black  exits  white  latino  black  david williams dznyc november   in his pennsylvania poll trafalgar predicted that  percent of the electorate would be white  percent would be black and  percent would be latino gravis marketing in contrast predicts a turnout of  percent white  percent african american and  percent hispanic cahalys michigan poll assumes at turnout that is  percent white  percent black and  percent latino gravis marketing predicts  percent white  percent black and  percent latino the companys future is riding on the accuracy of its polls cahaly said we looked at this as an investment in showing people that we know what were doing  let the market judge the pennsylvania poll is here the michigan poll is here comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page
oprah winfrey just stabbed metoo documentary filmmakers kirby dick and amy ziering in the back by abruptly pulling out of their upcoming movie which means they have lost their distributor the history of this as laid out by showbiz  is extremely revealing about just what a terrible person oprah is none of this is at all surprising at least not to me lets not forget were talking about the same oprah winfrey who falsely accused an innocent shopgirl of racism back in  to help promote a movie by the way the movie in question and this is important  was the butler which was produced by harvey weinstein the disgraced mogul currently on trial for rape its no secret either that oprah and weinstein became close during this time and that oprah very much appreciated the failed campaign weinstein launched to win her an oscar a little history prior to the weinstein allegations that ushered in the metoo era dick and ziering had already made a mark in this world with the hunting ground a well received  documentary about sexual assault on college campuses which ironically was distributed by the weinstein company there was some controversy over the accuracy of the film but thats another matter what matters here is that dick and ziering are not fly by nights the hunting ground was nominated for and won all kinds of awards so they were perfectly positioned to be taken seriously once metoo rocked the world they also won an oscar nomination for the invisible war which looked at rape accusations in the military and so just two weeks after the weinstein scandal broke wide open in late  the pair announced their next documentary would center on sexual assault in hollywood with an obvious focus on weinstein friedman explains what happened next this past december however dick and ziering announced that their film had changed focus to the record business and major figure oprah was suddenly on board weinstein was no longer being discussed as simmons took his place so now theres no weinstein film and oprah has dealt the filmmakers a significant blow by making a public exit shes also declared their film somehow unfit for release at least under her auspices so when the documentary which is titled on the record was going to focus on weinstein there was no involvement from oprah but once the focus changed to a major figure in the record biz  russell simmons  oprahs suddenly on board we dont know if oprah was a catalyst for shifting the focus away from weinstein and on simmons or if she came on board after the focus had already shifted what we do know is that this is the same oprah who put her considerable weight no pun intended behind leaving neverland the hbo documentary that accused a deceased michael jackson of serially abusing two young boys for years oprah caught a lot of flak for jumping on the leaving neverland train to begin with jackson is dead and unable to defend himself the two accusers the doc focused on are now contradicting earlier claims jackson never abused them both are seeking money from the jackson estate and then a gigantic hole was found in one of the accusers story he who claimed to have been abused at jacksons neverland train station the only problem is that the train station did not exist at that time and then to keep her ride on the oh so trendy metoo wave going she jumps aboard the simmons expos two black icons black and people noticed left wing activist bishop talbert swan blistered oprah on social media referring to unconfirmed rumors about metoo problems in oprahs own family talbert tweeted since oprah is concerned about alleged sexual assault victims of black men maybe shell do a doc on the young lady seeking support from the vernon winfrey scholarship fund to attend tn state u but got flashed touched and coerced for sex he followed this up with oprahs mantra is believevictims when it comes to michael jackson r kelly bill cosby russell simmons and every other black man he added should that not apply to her daddy should it apply to her buddy harvey weinstein other white men rapper  cent pointed out the same on his instagram account i dont understand why oprah is going after black men no harvey weinstein no epstein just michael jackson and russell simmons this shit is sad back in december simmons himself asked oprah why she chose to single him out in a lengthy instagram post he wrote in part dearest oprah you have been a shining light to my family and my community contributing so much to my life that i couldnt list a fraction of it  this is why its so troubling that you choose me to single out in your recent documentary i have already admitted to being a playboy more appropriately titled today womanizer sleeping with and putting myself in more compromising situations than almost any man i know so many that some could reinterpret or reimagine a different recollection of the same experiences please note that your producers said that this upcoming doc was to focus only on  hand chosen women i have refused to get in the mud with any accusers but lets acknowledge what i have shared i have taken and passed nine  hour lie detector tests and now just days before the january  premiere of the simmons documentary at sundance oprah not only bails shes attacking the film as not ready and questioning the veracity of one of simmons accusers while claiming she still believes her in a statement released this week oprah said of her abrupt exit i have decided that i will no longer be executive producer on the untitled kirby dick and amy ziering documentary and it will not air on apple tv first and foremost i want it to be known that i unequivocally believe and support the women their stories deserve to be told and heard in my opinion there is more work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured and it has become clear that the filmmakers and i are not aligned in that creative vision but later she told the new york times there were inconsistencies in one of the accusers allegations and that she bailed because the documentary did not adequately address those inconsistencies oprah also said she felt pressure from simmons but that it had nothing to do with her decision to jump ship for their part dick and ziering said they received just  minutes notice prior to oprah releasing her statement pulling her support as ive already expressed countless times im more than a little disgusted by these public trials by way of reality show and social media and cable news and the very important documentary whether its michael jackson or russell simmons or scientology or roger ailes or robert durst or r kelly its a pop culture kangaroo court its un american to convict people to smear them forever as monsters outside a courtroom is disgusting the power of pop culture should be used to test the system not to notch a win for the michael jackson prosecutors after they failed to convince a jury setting my personal beliefs aside though look at how terrible oprah is is it not a fair question to ask why she only puts her considerable media power behind documentaries targeting black icons one of whom is dead is it not fair to ask why shes not using her considerable media power to dig into weinstein and jeffrey epstein and nbcs apparent covering up for weinstein and matt lauer and then to bail on these filmmakers to pull the distribution rug out from under them at the last second and to do it while undermining their film what a terrible person oprah winfrey is me me me me me follow john nolte on twitter noltenc follow

support among hispanics for president trump sits at  percent and the media are still freaking out over it that is higher than the percentage of the hispanic vote mitt romney earned in  and about even with john mccain in  the far left atlantic is alarmed enough that it poured hundreds and hundreds of words all over the problem having worked at the congressional hispanic caucus during the obama administration i am firmly aware of the power of the latino vote and so i have been watching these numbers with alarm  in an election that will likely come down to the smallest margins of victory the consistent support for trump from a small but vocal subset of latino voters is a real threat to democrats if unchanged this dynamic could have devastating repercussions for latinos and for the country as a whole how pathetic i mean honestly how ignorant does one have to be to believe a group of americans should all be voting the same way based only on skin color and ethnicity this mentality not only displays an ignorance of human nature but of history over and over again we have watched ethnic groups lose their ethnic tribalism as they become assimilated into the american system over time italians the irish and others have broken free of pack mentality to view themselves simply as americans and with this sociological change their voting patterns fall in line with other assimilated groups the same is coming true with hispanics watch this the most important issue to all latino voters is the economy the record breaking unemployment rate and booming economy for latinos is one of the many reasons president realdonaldtrump has more latino support than ever latinosfortrump pictwittercomciqzqqjbe  trump war room  text woke to  trumpwarroom february   this truth is why the media and democrats but i repeat myself work so hard to keep black americans feeling like others in america like perpetual victims the demonic effort the left puts towards keeping blacks separate from the american system  special schools pop culture outlets etc  is all about survival if more than  percent of blacks ever break away from the democrat plantation the democrat party is done as a national party the human nature aspect though is especially revealing and because im married to a mexican immigrant i can at least speak to that experience my wife was born in mexico english is her second language she did not become an american citizen until she reached her twenties nevertheless she is not only wholly americanized but as someone who followed the rules she is a firm supporter of trumps immigration policies if you want to offend my wife just try and hyphenate her americanism shes not a mexican american or hispanic american shes an american american this doesnt mean she denies her mexican heritage or even tries to hide it the music the food the language the traditions are still a part of her life and by osmosis they have become a part of mine  a welcome part only an ignorant fool would look at the color of my wifes skin and automatically assume she should vote and think a certain way and if you want to get an earful try it im sure you dont like the way trump treats your people the condescending leftist will sometimes ask her my people are americans my wife shoots back and to become an american i followed the rules filled out the paperwork paid the fees waited in the long lines and now that im an american i want to know whos in my country she also resents mexicans who come here to make america more like mexico if these people want to live in mexico they should live in mexico not break into my country to try and change it its really that simple like all of us she wants to see illegals treated humanely but she also wants them deported and she would be fine with deporting journalist jorge ramos as well who she sees as an open borders cancer on a country she loved enough to adopt people are people trump understands that which is why he will probably do much better with black and hispanic americans in  like all people they dont want to be pandered to what they want are jobs and rising incomes all of which trump is delivering but the idea that just because someones skin is brown they are okay with being invaded by illegals who steal jobs and depress the wages of law abiding americans is simply nuts follow john nolte on twitter noltenc follow his facebook page here please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

class in houston karen nation and kristi wrether were at the shiloh gun range and d archery to take advantage of the free concealed gun license class for the lgbt community she like other members of the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community spoke to breitbart texas they spoke of the fear they have had both before and especially after the june orlando pulse terrorist attack the lgbt community used to feel that the only safe place they could really be was in and with the community wrether said that was taken away after orlando she jumped at the chance to take the concealed carry class when it was offered by the shiloh gun range as a gay man in texas i have never felt safe in houston or in texas not even in a gay bar now there is a family owned business that believes in protecting the community this can restore the faith in the community a little bit more said jordan managerrie winston explained she was there to learn how to protect her family her church family and herself rafael added you get to feel safe again we were bullied when we were kids said shylah she explained she was in a class where a business was treating them all like human beings this made her feel more secure in who i am when asked about the federal governments attempt to white wash the orlando pulse club terrorists ties to islam shylah answered you cannot use gun control to brush it under the rug it would be very irresponsible to do so as to the gun class she said being here is overwhelming in a way and she was there for the protection of my family shylah is heading up a project with  artists called pride for pulse she is gathering the artists and they will provide poems images or whatever they want to use to express themselves about what happened at the pulse gay nightclub in orlando as reported by breitbart texas the shiloh gun range in far northwest houston notified the lgbt community that they would be offering the free classes a notice on their website said at the time we offer our prayers and support to the lgbt community and classes to those interested in taking this new chl class please call the gun range has seen  people take the class and qualify for concealed carry licenses so far over  more have signed up and will be taking a class soon range owner jeff sanford says they have regrettably had to suspend the free offer but we consider it a blessing to have had the opportunity to introduce this group of people to the most important of all rights  their second amendment rights a church of christ minister for  years randy wells said he was helping to teach the classes this is not a gay issue it is a human issue wells is continuing to help teach the classes although he has caught some heat for doing so he told breitbart texas we dont live in happy days anymore and this is not mayberry he said it was just the right thing to do as it relates to politics he said gays have been more liberal but they are looking at constitutional rights and moving more to the center he said he has been told this has really opened up our eyes ken clark a veteran us marine was there to look out for everyone and to help avoid potential threats he was on the porch at the entrance of the gun range when breitbart texas arrived for interviews he said those at the range and attending the class were a prime target clark later said i want my america back and explained that folks now would rather be pc they would rather feel safe than be safe and called gun control ridiculous pam told breitbart texas that it was good to learn awareness techniques even if not carrying but added she was very excited about getting her concealed carry certification breitbart texas reported that organizers for the houston lgbt pride celebration declared the parade route and other pride events to be gun free zones the move came less than two weeks after the orlando islamic terrorist attack at a gay nightclub  another gun free zone it also followed a threat of gun violence on twitter the report of an alleged prohibition of the constitutional and statutory right to open carry and carry with a concealed handgun license on the streets of houston was met with strong condemnation by gun rights activists fortunately no attack occurred during the june houston pride festivities the lgbt gun rights group pink pistols has seen their membership grow from  to more than  since the orlando terrorist attack reported breitbart news awr hawkins on june  he reported in late june that gwendolyn patton spokesperson of the lgbt gun rights group pink pistols said we teach queers to shoot and we teach the world we did it the pink pistols have a quote from salon magazine on their website under a tab about the pink pistols using that quote they say they believe that in the thirty one states which allow qualified citizens to carry concealed weapons in those states homosexuals should embark on organized efforts to become comfortable with guns learn to use them safely and carry them they should set up pink pistols task forces sponsor shooting courses and help homosexuals get licensed to carry and they should do it in a way that gets as much publicity as possible

north korea claimed to have identified its first suspected chinese coronavirus case on sunday a refugee who had fled the country three years ago and allegedly snuck back across the border last week while extremely rare some of the thousands of north koreans who risk their lives to escape arguably the worlds most repressive country do return home many burdened by the shock of life in a free country according to south korean officials  north korean refugees returned home in the last five years among them a  year old believed to be the individual north korea claims to be exhibiting coronavirus symptoms on its side of the border despite being surrounded by some of the countries most critically affected by the chinese coronavirus  including its origin country china and others like russia and south korea  the communist north korean regime has insisted that it has not diagnosed a single case of chinese coronavirus south korean media citing sources within north korea have reported that the real number of coronavirus deaths there is about  among an untold number of cases north korea reportedly placed its third largest city chongjin under a total lockdown in june a bizarre move for a country that claimed zero coronavirus cases nationwide on sunday kaesong  a border city best known as home to a failed industrial project with south korea and a joint liaison office for inter korean diplomacy that pyongyang blew up last month  reportedly also went until total lockdown the unnamed man at the center of north koreas alleged first coronavirus case returned to his birth country on july  according to north koreas state run pyongyang times the anti epidemic authorities said with several medical tests of the secretion of the intruders upper airway and blood suggesting possibilities of infection the state propaganda outlet asserted he was put under strict quarantine as a primary step and all the people in kaesong city who had contacted him and those who had been to the city over the last five days are being thoroughly checked out medically examined and quarantined with the help of the relevant sector state media reported that following the identification of a potential coronavirus case dictator kim jong un organized an emergency meeting of his top level officials to announce a maximum level emergency in the country at the meeting kim announced that he took the preemptive measure of totally blocking kaesong city and isolating each district and region from the other kim announced a top class emergency alert saying that everyone needs to face up to the reality of emergency he appealed to all to overcome the present epidemic crisis by not losing the focus of thinking and action practicing responsibility and devotion to be faithful and true to the leadership of the party central committee state media quoted kim as saying kim also reportedly scolded his officials for insufficiently strict border protection given that the alleged coronavirus case crossed into the country illegally south korean officials confirmed on monday that a north korean refugee had returned to the country recently south koreas joongang ilbo cited south korean military officials as confirming that the man in question probably swam through a drain to bypass barbed wire fences on the border after being accused of raping a female fellow defector on june  at his residence in gimpo gyeonggi the man reportedly denied charges to police but admitted he was too drunk to remember the details of his encounter with the accuser he reportedly fled after police issued a warrant for his arrest south korean news sources have only identified the man by the common last name kim the officials did not offer any evidence that the man in question had exhibited coronavirus symptoms before leaving the country the south korean news agency yonhap appeared to find some evidence verifying that the man north korea claimed could be its first chinese coronavirus carrier did indeed exist  a youtube video on a channel run by north korean refugees in which he tells the story of how he escaped the country the story appeared to match what both north and south korean media reported the man in the video claimed to be from kaesong and left after the koreas shut down the joint industrial complex in the city the first reason i decided to defect from the north was hardships of living  as the kaesong industrial complex came to a halt my trade became difficult and i had no hope the man reportedly said in the video i got through a high voltage line and barbed wire fences at the demarcation line before crossing a minefield  before hiding inside a reed field near the han river for three hours the mans story is an uncommon one for north korean defectors many of which choose to travel through china to reach south korea instead of attempting to cross directly and face the intense military presence at the demilitarized zone dmz the kaesong industrial complex has long been a point of contention between the koreas even though it was built to improve ties between the two countries technically at war with each other for  years the industrial complex is an office and factory park meant to create jobs for north koreans where they would in theory work alongside south korean citizens to help live together and exchange experiences it was also intended to help north koreas communist economy improve its destitute state both countries have agreed to open and close it repeatedly in the past decade depending in large part on how aggressive the kim regime has decided to be against the south kim jong un has historically operated more aggressively against conservative south korean presidents human rights watch accused both nations of abusing workers at the complex in  conservative south korean president park geun hye decided to shut down the complex most recently in  a move the united states supported a year later kims regime announced that the park was running again staffed exclusively by north koreans in the aftermath of the election of leftist current president moon jae in kaesong went from hosting an industrial park for both koreas to a joint liaison office housing a phone on which both sides would speak twice a day the phone calls lasted two years before north korea announced it had bombed the office out of existence last month follow frances

during fridays democratic weekly address rep frank pallone d nj stated that the heroes act lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy transcript as follows hello im congressman frank pallone from new jersey this week our nation mourns the loss of  americans to the coronavirus its a staggering number and grim milestone families all around our nation continue to grieve lost ones oftentimes from a distance while its difficult to even comprehend this loss it reminds us that we must come together to combat this terrible virus so that we can save lives and protect communities in the weeks and months ahead this national emergency requires every aspect of government to work together we must reduce the spread of the virus so we can confidently begin to reopen our economy and get more than  million americans whove lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic back to work and the only way we can do that is through a coordinated national strategy a strategy that significantly boosts testing and invests resources into contact tracing surveillance and containment we simply cannot fight this pandemic if we dont know who has it and where it is being spread and that requires a national strategy and response unfortunately president trump and his administration have failed to provide the consistent and stable leadership that is necessary to guard our nation through this public health and economic crisis instead of showing leadership competence and vision the trump administration is shirking all responsibility and is instead forcing states to find their own way out of this pandemic for months the president has refused to develop and implement a national testing program for months weve been promised millions of tests were right around the corner and that everyone that wanted a test could get one these promises have been hollow testing is getting better but public health experts continue to warn that our country is far short of the testing we need and the failure of national leadership has forced states to compete against each other to procure tests and the vital supplies needed to administer tests from the private market we simply cannot allow the trump administrations failures to persist and thats why house democrats took bold action and passed the heroes act earlier this month this legislation continues our ongoing commitment to providing the health care resources and support needed to combat the coronavirus crisis the heroes act will strengthen testing by finally requiring the trump administration to develop comprehensive coordinated strategies for testing contact tracing and surveillance the administration will be required to include clear benchmarks and timelines it will also be forced to publicly report key metrics these requirements are critical to bringing much needed transparency to our nations response efforts it will allow us to see if the trump administration is fulfilling their promises and hold them accountable when they are not the heroes act also provides up to  billion in grants to support robust testing contact tracing surveillance and containment activities it also provides additional funding to communities that have a high number of covid  cases or are experiencing a surge as well as for areas with populations experiencing disparities this includes low income and the uninsured communities of color people with disabilities and other underserved communities we simply cannot beat this virus without these efforts in place the heroes act builds on the progress we have made and lays the foundation we will need to ease social distancing and safely reopen the economy now its time for the senate to act unfortunately to date senate majority leader mcconnell continues to delay and obstruct this cannot continue with more than  americans dead we must collectively find solutions like the heroes act that will help us finally stop the spread of this virus it is the only way we will be able to protect the american people and safely and confidently reopen our communities i thank you for listening and please stay safe follow ian hanchett on twitter ianhanchett please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

a us intelligence assessment states that the chinese communist party is intimidating the loved ones of soldiers killed in a bloody brawl on the indian border out of honoring their dead us news  world report claimed monday chinese and indian soldiers came to blows in late june in the galwan valley an area in indias ladakh region in the himalayas after indian soldiers found that peoples liberation army pla troops had established tents on the indian side of the border according to multiple reports the pla troops began attacking the indian forces when confronted as india and china had a longstanding agreement  which india has backed out of after this incident  not to allow their troops to use firearms against each other on the border the pla soldiers attacked their indian counterparts with rocks sticks and wooden polls wrapped in barbed wire some soldiers died being flung off the steep cliffs of the area while others reportedly died of hypothermia the indian government reported  deaths and several injuries in their ranks identifying them publicly by name and honoring them with funerals and public condolences to their families beijing has refused to offer any casualty count or acknowledge much less name any dead pla soldiers indian officials estimated that about twice the number of chinese died in the incident compared to the number of indian troops us news now claims to have evidence that beyond hiding its casualty counts the chinese communist party is actively trying to obscure the identities of the dead to prevent information about the damage it sustained from going public the chinese ministry of civil affairs has told families of those who died in the galwan valley clash that they must forgo traditional burial ceremonies and cremate the soldiers remains the newspaper attributed to an unnamed source those who wanted to hold services were told to do so remotely without attracting the attention of the general public the source continued relatives were apparently told that gatherings like funerals could potentially spread the chinese coronavirus which dictator xi jinping said in march was no longer a problem in china though the government has used the threat posed by coronavirus as a pretext the assessment concludes that the new rules are a part of a deliberate effort by beijing to undermine public awareness and erase any enduring reminders of the violent clash us news claimed china reportedly fears that images of gravestones for its fallen soldiers of the peoples liberation army or pla could further stoke those sentiments if spread on chinese or international social media asian news international ani indias largest news service added the observation that it appears that china is not willing to recognise the casualties it suffered in the galwan valley clash the grieving chinese families who have lost their loved ones in the clash are being mistreated by the chinese government as per the report ani asserted not only the chinese government refused to accept the casualties it is also denying the burial of the soldiers the reports complement earlier rumblings online that some of the relatives of soldiers whose status remains unknown since the incident have attempted to make public statements on chinese social media about the situation only to have their posts censored in late june shortly after the clash the outlet india today claimed to have documented posts on weibo a communist party controlled social media outlet similar to twitter that expressed frustration that the soldiers hurt or killed in the clash did not receive any respects from beijing india has held a memorial service for the sacrificial soldiers it shows the high respect and attention of the whole country of india to the soldiers who defend the country and the land it shows the high degree of solidarity of the indian nation what about us one alleged post read before being censored we should learn from india and show respect to our soldiers while beijing has not openly admitted to casualties it has used its state media arms to affirm that some soldiers did die the global times often its most belligerent english language media arm urged as an afterthought in a piece about an unrelated festival following the recent china india border clash our brave pla soldiers should never be forgotten the global times also denied indian officials claims that the chinese had been soundly defeated in ladakh calling the report utter fantasy without offering the alleged truth however the times did not provide any alternative to believe but the indian government account chinese troops started to retreat from where they had invaded indian territory in early july after several rounds of talks with indian counterparts satellite images showing that the offending tents the pla established in india had disappeared after a visit by indian prime minister narendra modi to the border where he praised indias military as the worlds best and declared the age of expansionism is over in addition to not confirming or identifying any chinese casualties chinese dictator xi jinping has been notably absent from any chinese government response to the incident please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

communist party officials in beijing were extremely dissatisfied with the landslide defeat of their candidates in this weeks hong kong district council elections and may be seeking to replace its local representatives in the region radio free asia rfa reported on tuesday citing analysts and unnamed sources within the government speaking to reuters rfa claimed that the heads of the communist party in hong kong persuaded chinese officials in the capital to believe that the millions strong protests in the capitalist city that have raged since june were not representative of the vast majority of hong kong residents who feared making their favorable opinions of communism known sundays election shattered that conception as voters overwhelmingly chose pro democracy anti chinese candidates in the privacy of the ballot box pro china local lawmakers now only control one of  district council  islands council on the outskirts of the region where most of the members of the lawmaking body were not on the ballot now beijing is seeking to remodel its presence in hong kong to prevent such a blowout from repeating in the future part of the official narrative has been the presumed existence of a silent majority who support the government and police love china and are angry with the long running disruption to their daily lives and the use of force by frontline protesters rfa explained sundays election result gave the lie to that view but analysts said it is entirely possible that officials in beijing were told this by local representatives and believed it china may now replace the heads of its hong kong liaison office and other key officials there is no indication they would replace hong kong chief executive carrie lam though lam has indicated in the past that she deserves to step down and would do so if asked lam later claimed the media misinterpreted her remarks surreptitiously recorded at a private event beijing is extremely dissatisfied with sundays election result chinese university of hong kong expert willy lam told rfa they didnt expect the pro beijing parties to lose so badly so now they are looking for someone to blame lam noted that the hong kong liaison office has failed not only in bolstering pro chinese sentiment among regular people but in uniting the so called pro beijing forces including pro beijing parties like the democratic alliance for the betterment and progress of hong kong dab the protest movement also spread internationally to add to the embarrassment of the communist party kurt zindulka dab was once the majority party in the district councils it now retains only  of over  seats though some pro democracy candidates accused the government of maliciously interfering in the voter process and the hong kong election board banned activist joshua wong one of the most prominent members of the protest movement from running the chinese regime appeared to interfere minimally in the election the result was an overwhelming win in nearly every district for anti communist candidates in an election boasting the highest turnout in hong kong history over  percent of eligible voters adding insult to injury hong kongers took the streets of the city during their lunch breaks on monday to celebrate the victory openly pouring out champagne in public the chinese communist regime blamed the united states australia and other western nations for allegedly meddling in elections without offering any evidence to back its claims the united states making use of its domestic law wantonly interfered in chinas internal affairs and attempted to undermine one country two systems and the prosperity and stability of the hong kong special administrative region violating the united nations charter and the basic norms governing international relations foreign minister wang yi said in the aftermath of the elections chinas state propaganda outlets also alleged without evidence that pro democracy protesters used dirty tricks such as confusing older voters into supporting pro democracy candidates and flooding voting lines with non voters to extend wait times to defeat communist candidates the result of sundays district council election marks a setback for hong kongs democratic development as the results were skewed by the illegal activities of the opposition camp to the benefit of their candidates china daily claimed the pro china hong kong establishment has diverged from that tactic the hong kong election board affirmed that the elections occurred in a free and fair atmosphere carrie lam acknowledged widespread disappointment in the city with the government but rejected accusations that her government was responsible as she does not administer the district councils district council positions are the only ones that hong kong voters can choose directly by ballot the more powerful legislative council seats are controlled partially by voters but most are chosen by special interest groups with ties to beijing the nature of these elections is simply to elect district council members to serve on the  district councils it is not for the government and myself to give it another interpretation lam said on tuesday i havent received any sign that i should be held responsible from the central government i said that we would seriously reflect on these views expressed to us and improve governance in the future of our work she added lam categorically rejected personal blame in the elections her government has also rejected the protest movements remaining demands after withdrawing a controversial bill that would have allowed china to extradite anyone present in hong kong the protest movement continues to demand four reforms of its government freedom for political prisoners direct election of legislative council lawmakers an independent investigation into police brutality and the removal of the word riot to describe the peaceful june  protest follow frances

a top civil servant at the foreign office has said that the british government has made a firm decision on allowing chinese tech giant huawei to help build the united kingdoms g network and the arrangement will not be reconsidered asked whether he would advise secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs dominic raab to reevaluate the uks position sir simon mcdonald the foreign offices permanent undersecretary told mps at the foreign affairs select committee on tuesday as you know the government decided to proceed with an investment but with very strict conditions as far as i know that is a firm decision and is not being reopened china is a very important partner of the united kingdom and i think its compatible to proceed with the huawei decision and have the strategically independent relationship that i have been talking about sir simon added in comments reported by reuters in january prime minister boris johnson signed off on the involvement of huawei in the future development of the countrys g data networks despite the government saying that the chinese company would be working on non essential parts of the system  capping its involvement at  per cent  ministers and anglosphere allies have warned that participation by the chinese company could cause a security risk huawei is widely held to be controlled by the communist chinese state and reportedly used by beijing for spying the united states has warned that huawei has back door access inbuilt into its networks causing concern that the chinese communist party ccp could use huawei technology in the uks g network to secretly access sensitive and personal information farage huawei in uk g may be price for accepting chinas coronavirus aid httpstcomcgrcfsoj  breitbart london breitbartlondon april   in immediate response to mr johnsons decision us secretary of state mike pompeo flew over to the united kingdom to discuss the controversial move while mr pompeo assured the prime minister that the huawei decision would not affect us uk relations and that britain remains at the front of the line for a post brexit trade deal later reports circulated claimed that johnsons decision had caused fractures with key anglosphere intelligent sharing partners the five eyes president trump had allegedly slammed the phone down on boris johnson in a row over the chinese tech firm and australian mps had cancelled a visit to the uk the move also proved unpopular domestically in february former conservative party leadership candidate and brexiteer david davis branded it the governments worst intelligence decision since mis recruitment of traitor and soviet cold war asset kim philby while in february a group of former cabinet ministers including sir iain duncan smith said that huaweis involvement in british telecommunications networks made as much sense as involving nazi germany in radar technology development in early  dissatisfaction over the prime ministers decision resulted in  tory mps rebelling in a commons vote on an amendment to a telecommunications bill in early february the rebellion is unlikely to have cooled in the intervening month particularly in light of the chinese coronavirus crisis during which credible claims have come to light that the ccp withheld vital information about the wuhan virus from the rest of the world in the early weeks of the outbreak senior tories accuse chinese interests of exploiting coronavirus crisis to dominate uk tech httpstcovyifdme  breitbart london breitbartlondon april   despite the foreign offices permanent undersecretary saying that the government will not reconsider its decision government insiders speaking to bloomberg last week believe that conservative mps positions are hardening against the chinese firm and that it may be difficult to pass legislation permitting huawei access to britains g network it is not just british mps and international anglosphere allies pressing britain to reconsider its decision tech companies are also urging the uk to find g alternatives to huawei in a letter seen by axios and reported on monday firms including japans nec wrote to the house of commons defence committee chairman tobias elwood asking the government to ditch its plan to allow high risk vendors access to the uks sensitive telecommunications network saying it is possible to put in place the most technologically advanced g infrastructure without the chinese company brexit party leader nigel farage said of huawei earlier this year once huawei is in the g network getting it out will be all but impossible for this reason johnson must reverse his decision to allow huawei to take such a big position in creating g a full scale rebellion within britains ruling conservative party is the only way he can be guaranteed to change his mind we didnt free britain from brussels only to bow before beijing he said farage huawei decision threatens five eyes trade even future of nato

sign up for our newsletter sen ted cruz r tx and businessman donald trump went toe to toe in a thrilling exchange at the gop debate in charleston south carolina on thursday evening as they debated cruzs constitutional eligibility for the presidency the fight which opened the second round of questions was triggered by moderator neil cavuto who asked cruz directly whether the fact that he had been born in canada meant he was not a natural born citizen sign up for our newsletter then this cavuto senator cruz now you are of course a strict constitutionalist no one would doubt that and as you know the ua constitution says only natural born citizens are elgible for the office of president of the united states stop me if you heard this before now you were born you were born in canada to an american mother so you were and are considered an american citizen but that fellow next to you donald trumpand othershave said being born in canada means you are not natural born and that has raised questions about your eligibility do you want to try to close this topic once and for all tonight cruz laughs well neil im glad were focusing on the important topics of the evening laughter applause back in september my friend donald said that hed had his lawyers look at this from every which way and there was no issue there there was nothing to this birther issue laughter now since september the constitution hasnt changed laughter but the poll numbers have applause and i recognize i recognize that donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in iowa but the facts and the law here are really quite clear under longstanding us law the child of a us citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen if a soldier has a child abroad that child is a natural born citizen that is why john mccain even though he was born in panama was eligible to run for president if an american missionary has a child abroad that child is a natural born citizen thats why george romney mitts dad was eligible to run for president even though he was born in mexico at end of the day the legal issue is quite straightforward but i would note that the birther theories that donald has relying on some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on us soil but have two parents born on us soil under that theory not only would i be disqualified marco rubio would be disqualified bobby jindal would be disqualifiedand interestingly enough donald j trump would be disqualified applause because because donalds mother was born in scotland she was naturalized now donald  trump but i was born here cruz on the issue of citizenship donald trump big difference cruz on issue of citizenship donald im not going to use your mothers birth against you laughter trump because it wouldnt work cruz youre an american as is everybody else on this stage and i would suggest we focus on whos best prepared to be commander in chief because thats the most important question facing the country applause cavuto mr trumpyou raised it because of his rising poll numbers trump let me tell you something and you know because you saw the numbers yourself nbc wall street journal came out with a poll headlined trump way up cruz going down i mean so dont boossee you cant you cant they dont like the wall street journal they dont like nbc but i like the poll and frankly it just came outand in iowa now as you know ted in the last three polls im beating you so you shouldnt misrepresent how well youre doing with the polls applause you dont have to say that in fact i was all for you until you started doing that because thats a misrepresentation number one number two this isnt me saying it i dont care i think i will win fair and square i dont have to win this way thank you laurence tribe and numerousfrom harvard of harvardsaid that there is a serious question as to whether or not ted can do this okay there are other attorneys that feeland very very fine constitutional attorneysthat feel that because he was not born on the land he cannot run for office heres the problem were running were running he does great i win i choose him as my vice presidential candidate and the democrats sue because we cant take him along for the ride i dont like that okay laughter the fact is and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field he beats the rest of the field who is boos see they dont like that they dont like that boos they dont like that he beats rest of the field because they want me if for some reason neil he beats rest of the field i already know the democrats are going to be bringing a suit you have a big lawsuit over your head while youre running and if you become the nominee who the hell knows if you can even serve in office so you should go out get a declaratory judgment let the courts decide and  cavuot why are you saying this now why are you raising this issue now trump because now he is doing a little bit better laugher boos no i didnt care if he no it is true ne never had a chance now he is doing better hes got probably a  or  chance boos applause cavuto thank you mr trump cruz neil trump the fact his there is a big overhang there is a big question mark on your head and you cant do that to the party you really cant you cant do that to the party you have to have certainty even if it was a  chance and its far greater than  because he wasnt bornyou have great constitutional lawyers say you cant run and you know im not bringing a suit i promise but the democrats are going to bring a lawsuit and you cantand you have to have certainty you cant have a question i can agree with you or not but you cant have a question over your head cavuto senator want to respond cruz listen i spent my entire life defending the constitution before the us supreme court and ill tell you im not going to be taking legal advice from donald trump applause trump you dont have to take it from laurence tribe take it from your professor take it from your own professor cruz but i will tell you the chances of any litigation proceeding and succeeding on this are zero now mr trump trump thats wrong its wrong cruz but mr trump is very focused on larry tribe let me tell you who larry tribe is left wing judicial activist harvard law professor al gores lawyer in bush v gore he is a major hillary clinton supporter there is a reason why hillary supporters are echoing donalds attacks on me because hillary wants to face donald trump in the general election trump he is not the only one not only one there are many lawyers cruz and ill tell you what donald you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the vp slot ill tell you what if this all works out im happy to consider naming you as vp and so if you happen to be right you could get the top job at end of the day applause trump no i thinki think if it doesnti like thatt i would consider it but i think i will go back to building buildings if it doesnt work out cruz actually id love you to build a wall trump

monday on cnn gov larry hogan r md said president donald trump wasted the early months of the coronavirus pandemic not taking it seriously hogan said ive been really proud of the governors on both sides of the aisle for really stepping up and taking this pandemic seriously i talk about that in the book and im not just out trying to criticize the president but i talk about the early stages of the pandemic when he wasnt taking it seriously enough he added there certainly were a number of people like dr fauci dr redfield and others who were making very serious arguments within the administration about why we needed to take certain actions the governors were paying attention to that advice and the president i think we wasted some time early on for a couple of months kind of downplaying the virus and not taking actions that needed to be taken like developing a nationwide testing strategy ramping up the production and availability of ppe and developing a contact tracing program so i think are there have been some improvements but theres no question that some of the governors took it more seriously than the president follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

in an interview with reasons nick gillespie on friday fox news analyst andrew napolitano said there was overwhelming evidence of impeachable actions by president donald trump napolitano said the democrats on the house intelligence committee have unearthed enough evidence in my opinion to justify about three or four articles of impeachment against the president we have to start this conversation by underscoring the fact that impeachment is not legal it is political its only constitutional base is treason bribery or other hard crimes and misdemeanors he contoued heres what i think the democrats will want nick heres what i think they will advance one is bribery the allegation is the technical definition of bribery is the failure to perform an official duty until a thing of value comes your way and they will argue that the presidents failure to disperse funds that the congress ordered be dispersed until the recipient of the funds agreed to investigate a potential political opponent is an act of bribery that is enough in my opinion to make it over the threshold of impeachable offenses i dont think its enough to convict of bribery but its enough to allege it for the purpose of impeachment the second charge will be high crimes and misdemeanors  election law violation the third crime will be obstruction of justice the fourth will be interference with the witness and the fifth maybe lying under oath he added the evidence of his impeachable behavior at this point in my view is overwhelming follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

fox news channels tucker carlson opened his wednesday evening program laying out the dire violent situation in chicago under the leadership of the citys mayor lori lightfoot carlson indicated the use of federal resources was justified and dismissed hyperbole from critics transcript as follows carlson for the past two months as you well know a small group of power hungry professional activists has screamed at the rest of us about saving lives theyre trying to keep people from dying they tell us they say that with total certainty and of course maximum self righteousness the rest of us they tell us just dont care about saving lives we are selfish and immoral and we must be punished for that the activists yell all of this at high volume theyve yelled it for so long now unchallenged that many otherwise sensible people have begun to believe it and to take them seriously our richest corporations have sent them millions of dollars our media praise them as heroes our political leaders terrified and confused do whatever they say but are these activists telling the truth do they mean what they say do they actually care about saving lives these are vitally important questions because they will determine the course of policies in the coming years that could totally reshape this country so its worth finding the answers to do that turn down the volume a little bit ignore what the slogans are screaming at you ignore the graffiti theyre painting in your cities instead consider the evidence watch what theyve done in chicago for instance as in so many american cities activists have demanded that the police stop enforcing the law police and laws are illegitimate they claim now theres no evidence that that is true but craven city leaders in chicago and many other places have obeyed them anyway the police have been forced to stand down so what happened next well heres the result in chicago in the last month alone literally hundreds of americans have been gunned down there just last night for example at least  people were shot in a single incident outside a funeral home in the city some of that chaos was caught on surveillance tape watch this video clip plays carlson the first thing youll notice about that tape after the sound is that it was light out the killers pulled up in full view and simply started shooting people with impunity bodies fell on the sidewalk the wounded screamed but the gunfire continued this wasnt baghdad it was americas third largest city its hard to believe this is happening here but the activists dont care they made this possible they did this but theyre not organizing marches to protest this violence theyre ignoring it completely the white house is not ignoring it the administration has said it will send federal law enforcement agents to chicago to restore order to stop these killings the citys mayor a living parody of entitlement and incompetence called lori lightfoot has promised to prevent that help from arriving under no circumstances  she tweeted   will i allow donald trumps troops to come to chicago and terrorize our residents in lori lightfoots chicago law enforcement is banned only gang members are allowed to terrorize the population and they do begin video clip unidentified female voice over sadly once again the victims of chicago gun violence are kids todays shooting injured cousins two boys ages  and  unidentified female voice over the vehicle pulled up and three men got out of that vehicle and started shooting on the block that was just filled with children unidentified male voice over the fourth of july weekend marked by devastating gun violence across the country and in chicago more than  people were shot and at least  killed including a  year old boy and a seven year old girl its the third week in a row that children have died from gun violence in chicago end video clip carlson its just awful but nothing you just saw affects lori lightfoot in any way lori lightfoot is surrounded at all times by armed bodyguards paid for by her suffering subjects she demands that lori lightfoot understands that chicago is a highly dangerous place but for the ordinary people who live in her crumbling city things look very different they dont have taxpayer funded bodyguards their chicago was a place where seven year olds maybe their seven year olds get murdered in broad daylight and local politicians like lightfoot do nothing about it so for them in the face of violence like that law enforcement isnt primarily a political issue cops arent quote donald trumps troops theyre vital to survival without them people die they know that cops are mostly just blue collar americans who in some cases risk their lives to stop the murder of children so watch what happens when a local tv reporter asks people on the streets of chicago what they think of sending federal law enforcement to their city begin video clip question so president trump is sending federal troops to various cities around the country if you look over there youll see some  what look to be some people in black  unidentified male i am going to be honest  unidentified female i think we need that we honestly need that unidentified male yes i feel better thumbs up  because  i give it a thumbs up because of the violence this continuum day in and day out weekend little children and its just unnatural that all of is violence like were literally in a war zone end video clip carlson like were literally in a war zone he says you hear that phrase a lot but in this case the man you just saw is not far off when cities are at war law and order disappear no one is in charge no one is in control the only people with power are those willing to use violence parts of chicago look like that right now children as young as  on the southside have committed at least a dozen carjackings overall so far this year  people have been shot in the city of chicago   people that is the equivalent of more than  fully loaded boeing s imagine those passenger planes lined up next to each other thats how many people it is its more than the entire population of  separate texas counties thats how many people have been shot in the city of chicago since january and there will almost certainly be many more before the year ends this is a disaster no matter what lori lightfoot claims chicago needs help from somewhere follow

trump now believes that man made climate change is real claims a headline in mother jones top trolling guys almost worthy of the master djt himself in shift donald trump says humans may be causing global warming says pbs according to the washington post meanwhile president elect donald trump appears to be softening his tone on whether climate change is real and on his stated plans to scrap the recent multinational agreement to limit carbon emissions the name for this nonsense is fake news  as becomes clear when you read the transcripts of what president elect trump actually said at his meeting with the new york times thomas l friedman opinion columnist but its really important to me and i think to a lot of our readers to know where youre going to go with this i dont think anyone objects to you know doing all forms of energy but are you going to take america out of the worlds lead of confronting climate change trump im looking at it very closely tom ill tell you what i have an open mind to it were going to look very carefully its one issue thats interesting because there are few things where theres more division than climate change you dont tend to hear this but there are people on the other side of that issue who are think dont even  arthur sulzberger jr publisher of the new york times we do hear it so at this point trump is gently introducing the nyts liberals to the concept that not everyone thinks the same way on climate change as they do lets carry on shall we friedman i was on squawk box with joe kernen this morning so i got an earful of it laughter trump joe is one of them but a lot of smart people disagree with you i have a very open mind and im going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and were going to look at it very carefully but i have an open mind sulzberger well since were living on an island sir i want to thank you for having an open mind we saw what these storms are now doing right weve seen it personally straight up friedman but you have an open mind on this trump i do have an open mind and weve had storms always arthur sulzberger not like this trump you know the hottest day ever was in  something  you know you can make lots of cases for different views i have a totally open mind my uncle was for  years a professor at mit he was a great engineer scientist he was a great guy and he was  a long time ago he had feelings  this was a long time ago  he had feelings on this subject its a very complex subject im not sure anybody is ever going to really know i know we have they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists where was that in geneva or wherever five years ago terrible where they got caught you know so you see that and you say whats this all about i absolutely have an open mind i will tell you this clean air is vitally important clean water crystal clean water is vitally important safety is vitally important and you know you mentioned a lot of the courses i have some great great very successful golf courses ive received so many environmental awards for the way ive done you know ive done a tremendous amount of work where ive received tremendous numbers sometimes ill say im actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand thats true open mind trump it is obvious to anyone with half a brain is taking the piss he is telling the nyts liberal assembly i hear what you say and then ever so nicely indicating that he doesnt give a toss the way he repeats that phrase open mind hes trolling them basically especially where he tells them hes an environmentalist classic trump james bennet editorial page editor when you say an open mind you mean youre just not sure whether human activity causes climate change do you think human activity is or isnt connected trump i think right now  well i think there is some connectivity there is some something it depends on how much it also depends on how much its going to cost our companies you have to understand our companies are noncompetitive right now theyre really largely noncompetitive about four weeks ago i started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my speeches that weve lost  factories since w bush  when i first looked at the number i said that must be a typo it cant be  you cant have  you wouldnt think you have  factories here and it wasnt a typo its right weve lost  factories were not a competitive nation with other nations anymore we have to make ourselves competitive were not competitive for a lot of reasons thats becoming more and more of the reason because a lot of these countries that we do business with they make deals with our president or whoever and then they dont adhere to the deals you know that and its much less expensive for their companies to produce products so im going to be studying that very hard and i think i have a very big voice in it and i think my voice is listened to especially by people that dont believe in it and well let you know well let you know in other words ill get back to you in other words sorry not interested in your business got better

tuesday on msnbcs andrea mitchell reports president barack obamas national security adviser susan rice addressed reports she was responsible for the unmasking of names of trump associates after the election during the transition period rice said unmaking names in intelligence reports she received is standard procedure insisting i leaked nothing to nobody adding there is no equivalence between unmasking and leaking rice said the allegation is that somehow obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes that is absolutely false i was the national security advisor my job is to protect the american people and the security of our country thats the same as the secretary of state the secretary of defense the cia director and every morning to enable us to do that we receive from the intelligence community a compilation of intelligence reports that the intelligence community selected for us on a daily basis to give us the best information as to what is going on around the world i received those reports as did each of the other officials and there were occasions when i would receive a report in which a us person was referred to name not provided just us person and sometimes in that context in order to understand the importance of the report and assess its significance it was necessary to find out or request the information as to who the us official was she continued i leaked nothing to nobody and never have and never would let me explain this first to talk about the contents of a classified report  to talk about the individuals on the foreign side who were the targets of the report itself or any americans that may have collected upon incidentally is to disclose classified information im not going to do that those people putting these stories out are doing just that i cant describe any particular report and i have no idea what re reports  i dont know the time frame the subject matter and i dont know who they think was collected upon she added when the intelligence community would respond to a request to identify an american that would come back only to the person requested it brought back to them directly to me or to whoever might have requested it on occasion and this is important it was not then typically broadly disseminated throughout the nation security community or the government so the notion that some people are trying to suggest that by asking for the identity of an american person that is the same as leaking it is completely false there is no equivalence between so called unmasking and leaking follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

with only months left before before leaving office president obama is committed to securing ratification of the united nations arms trade treaty att att has been an on again off again project of the obama administration during both terms of his presidency particularly his first term in  the nra warned this treaty threatens individual firearm ownership with an invasive registration scheme and is full of regulations and requirements that are blatant attacks on the constitutional rights of every law abiding american the treaty does this in part by urging record keeping of end users directing importing countries to provide information to an exporting country regarding arms transfers including end use or end user documentation for a minimum of ten years  to require recording keeping on end users is nothing other than requiring registration of end users in fact breitbart news warned that firearm registration must proceed from the att if it is to be enforceable this is a logical but freedom crushing consequence when part of the treatys focus is stopping the movement of small arms and light weapons across borders how are agents tasked with enforcing this treaty going to ascertain the origin of smuggled weapons without a comprehensive registration on file yet even with all the evidence and warnings that an international registry would certainly follow any us agreement to comport with the treaty and even though republicans in the senate had already made clear the treaty would not be ratified secretary of state john kerry signed it on september   the goal appeared to be put everything in place so a future democrat dominated senate could revisit the att ratify it and get the us on the road to international gun control and on september  the daily signal reported that obama is still committed to ratification of the treaty before he leaves office if he can find a way to secure it it is interesting to note that some countries that ratified treaty have already taken the occasion of international gatherings to bash gun laws in the us on august  breitbart news reported that mexican foreign minister claudia ruiz massieu used part of her time at the second conference of state parties of the arms trade treaty to blame mexicos gun violence on the us and to criticize the us for not having an assault weapons ban according to insight crime ruiz believes that supermarkets in the us are stocking guns she said it is as easy to get guns as it is to get a liter of milk or a box of cereal comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

chinas state media posted several articles on monday and tuesday defending its use of internment camps to force ethnic uighur muslims to abandon their language and faith including an interview with an official in western xinjiang province who claimed the camps were vocational education institutions equipped with basketball courts and hairdressing classes chinas global times published two articles on monday defending the use of internment camps to forcibly separate uighur families replace the uighur language with mandarin and indoctrinate uighurs with communist propaganda xinjiang is home to the nations largest uighur population and borders much of muslim central asia it is home to the east turkestan islamic movement etim an islamic separatist movement chinese communist authorities claim the existence of etim necessitates separating uighur families and replacing islam with worship of the communist party in a column referring to the use of internment camps as a soft landing to peace the global times attacked human rights groups in the west for condemning their use and defending the rights of the uighur minority since the beginning of this year some western media and politicians have been viciously attacking actions adopted by xinjiang to help those affected by extremism to return to their families and society through educational transformation the piece claimed radical western politicians and media have set off a wave of anti china rhetoric and xinjiang has become their new target those western forces dont care about the welfare of the xinjiang people they would rather sacrifice stability in xinjiang and the lives of hundreds of thousands for a single geopolitical victory over china the piece continues calling the camps  believed to house between one and two million people fundamentally different from internment camps trainees learn the national language laws and job skills in the institutes western forces accuse the authorities of religious persecution the global times complains the west the piece concludes is just messing up the whole thing and creating a narrative against china xinhua the main chinese government news agency published an interview tuesday with xinjiang governor shohrat zakir elaborating on what china claims occurs in these re education camps the interview presented in zakirs own words presents the image of a mandatory boarding school for anyone considered a threat to commit unspecified crimes the individuals forced to live there are suspected of minor criminal offenses that do not warrant criminal punishment there is no indication that police ever prove their guilt before forcing them to undergo education at these institutions nor is their internment described as imprisonment instead zakir claims that these individuals receive free vocational training through vocational education institutions to improve their ability in commanding the countrys common language acquiring legal knowledge and vocational skills among others zakir claims the training helps enhance their understanding of chinese history culture and national conditions to agree with the point of view of the communist party zakir also describes the facilities themselves as follows courses on clothing and footwear making food processing electronic product assembly typesetting and printing hairdressing and e commerce have been set up to suit local social needs and job market multi skill training is provided to trainees who have the desire and capability to learn so that they acquire one to two vocational skills upon graduation the cafeteria prepares nutritious free diets and the dormitories are fully equipped with radio tv air conditioning bathroom and shower indoor and outdoor sports venues for basketball volleyball and table tennis have been built along with reading rooms computer labs film screening rooms as well as performance venues such as small auditoriums and open air stages the interview omits facts that journalists and human rights groups have revealed in interviews with survivors of the camps and guards there one unnamed guard told radio free asia rfa this month for example that those undergoing education are under constant surveillance and have strict rules for where they can hold their hands at any given time prior reports have revealed that the cafeterias force muslims to eat pork and the children of those chosen for the camps are typically taken into orphanages or homes where they are taught mandarin and raised loyal to the communist party outside of the camps the communist party has launched a decisive battle against certification of halal products and forced xinjiang stores to sell haram items such as alcohol and cigarettes human rights advocates appear unconvinced of the legality of these internment camps under international law noting the heavy communist party indoctrination evidence suggests goes on in the camps these camps remain blatantly unlawful and arbitrary under both chinese and international law and the suffering and abuses of what is estimated to be one million people in them cannot be wiped away through propaganda maya wang a senior china researcher

sign up for our newsletter washington dcgovernor john kasichs hopes that he had overcome the anti gun reputation he had earned for supporting the clinton gun ban in  may now be dashed after he told two separate sunday talk shows that he is considering nominating a supreme court justice who might abolish the second amendment while kasich often calls himself a conservative when running in gop primaries those familiar with his record say he is the epitome of an establishment moderate he joined obamacare by forcing through its medicaid expansion over the opposition of the ohio legislature supports common core tells conservatives that they need to drop opposition to same sex marriage and even believes that christian bakers who still support traditional marriage should be required to bake cakes for same sex weddings that violate their faith sign up for our newsletter but in recent years one issue on which kasich had followed the conservative line is the right to keep and bear arms in a testament to the national rifle associations political prowess and strategic planning there are few parts of the country where republicans can win primaries without pledging support for the second amendment the same holds true even for democrats in the general elections of many states this was a problem for kasich because in before the nra conclusively proved they had mastered the ability to mobilize gun rights supporterskasich voted for the clinton gun ban although called by the poll tested term assault weapons ban this legislation outlawed over a dozen standard issue firearms specifically ones that had outward features that gave them an appearance that bill clinton and his allies found easy to demonize the nra surged as never before after that bill became law and the clinton gun ban partly led to one of the most catastrophic election cycles democrats had ever seen the gop gained a majority in the us house for the first time in forty years and republicans took control of the us senate as well kasich kept his congressional seat but there was no way he could erase his vote instead of saying he opposes gun bans because they violate the second amendment kasich currently says he no longer supports them because the bans he has seen are not effective leaving open the possibility that he could support new gun bans if he thinks one would be effective but as the years passed and kasich did not support any new gun control bills this incident faded from memory gun owners became less concerned about kasichs former opposition to gun rights until last week when kasich told cbss face the nation and separately told nbcs meet the press that he would consider nominating judge merrick garland to take the supreme court seat of justice antonin scalia the famous author of the historic second amendment case district of columbia v heller but the nra strongly opposes garlands nomination to the supreme court chief lobbyist chris cox explains that scalias death could result in the end of individual gun ownership in the united states discussing garlands record and concluding that it shows he will join the other liberal justices to overturn heller  at the first opportunity after kasichs statement supporting garland nra members are looking at the buckeye states governor with a skeptical eye after one of the interviews he issued a short retraction that nbcs chuck todd mentioned on the air but gun owners seem unconvinced by what they regard as a halfhearted attempt at political damage control kasich has not given any major speeches about the importance of nominating conservative judges to the federal bench taken with his statements of support for what most republicans regard as a liberal democrat supreme court nominee and his flip flop on gun bans there is a growing chance that kasich could lose crucial gun owner votes in the remaining gop primaries ken klukowski is legal editor for breitbart news follow him on twitter kenklukowski comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

sign up for our newsletter through a verified twitter account friday the conservative political action committee cpac announced that at the last minute republican presidential frontrunner donald trump dropped out of his scheduled saturday appearance very disappointed realdonaldtrump has decided at the last minute to drop out of cpac cpac tweeted his choice sends a clear message to conservatives sign up for our newsletter  very disappointed realdonaldtrump has decided at the last minute to drop out of cpac  his choice sends a clear message to conservatives  cpac cpac march    the trump campaign released a statement the donald j trump for president campaign has just announced it will be in witchita kanasas for a major rally on saturday prior to caucus he will also be speaking at the kansas caucus and then departing for orlando florida and a crowd of approximately  people or more because of this he will not be able to speak at cpac as he has done for many consecutive years mr trump would like to thank matt schlapp and all of the executives at cpac and looks forward to returning to next year hopefully as president of the united states this is a blunder writes breitbarts joel pollak trump canceling cpac is a colossal blunder it is the proverbial shooting on th avenue trump needs to consolidate the support of conservatives to unify the party and win in the fall he knows it which is why he talked about unity on super tuesday now he says he needs to go to kansas where he is up by  points no cpac doesnt really matter much anymore and trumps rise suggests as allahpundit argues at hotair that the conservative movement has less influence than it thinks or as i would put it less pull in government than in opposition but conservatives dont want their noses rubbed in it trump still needs to flatter us mitt romneys pathetic speech on thursday took the wind out of the absurd nevertrump movement  which if it means what it says is prepared to elect hillary clinton but now nevertrump will attract more disgruntled conservatives because trump has exposed the weakness of the conservative brand and they have to save it i would add that cpac has itself to blame  and specifically the tea party jenny beth martin released an advance version of her speech this morning in which she rips donald trump in terms no different from mitt romney in the fall she built trump up at the rally to stop the iran deal thats a significant reversal my guess is that she figured trump is likely to win the nomination anyway so pounding him would not hurt and would preserve the tea partys outsider brand but that speech pushed all the wrong buttons it almost invited trump to pull out of cpac because it set him up for massive opposition if he dared to show up of course he still should have shown up sen john mccain r az  whom trump mocks showed up in  to face the boos because he needed to consolidate conservative support even though he had the votes by then to win the nomination cpacs hero that year was mitt romney which says a lot about many things trump has reinforced the idea that he is thin skinned which is something conservatives already dislike in obama worse he reinforced perceptions that he is a flip flopper at last nights debate he reversed his position on h b visas and had to issue a clarification pulling out of cpac hours later has the same effect will it hurt trump it wont block his path to the nomination but it might make it harder for him to bring conservatives to the polls in november the only good news for him is that both rubio and cruz will use this to make hay  ie neither has pulled out to help the other he should note conservatives vote in kansas too republican senator ben sasse a vocal trump critic attacks prediction not the last time realdonaldtrump will abandon conservatives mttrump drops out of cpac sends clear message to conservatives  ben sasse bensasse march   this piece will be updated as news arrives also check out the breitbart news live wire for continuous updates comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

jussie smollett appears to have picked the wrong location for his hate crime to be caught on video if we compare his good morning america interview to the latest reports about the two nigerian men who say the actor singer paid them to stage an assault as of now it looks as though police believe empire star smollett not only lied about a phony hate crime committed against him by supporters of president trump he also hoped to arrange for the hoax to be recorded by a surveillance camera according to cbs chicago smollett who is black and gay paid  to two brothers who are also black to stage a racist and homophobic attack on him if the reports are accurate smolletts planning was meticulous including rehearsals and the purchase of the items used in the attack smollett claimed he was accosted by two men in downtown chicago at about  am on january  he told police his attackers recognized him shouted racist and homophobic slurs beat him up poured bleach on him wrapped a noose around his neck and warned him that this is maga country a reference to the presidents make america great again slogan over the past  or so days according to various media reports the story has completely fallen apart police sources tell cbs chicago that the rope wrapped around smolletts neck was traced back to a purchase made by smollett himself whats more a search of the brothers apartment turned up bleach a red hat and a script from smolletts tv show empire apparently one or both of the brothers worked on the show with smollett cbs chicago adds the brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening the most important dot to connect to all of the above though comes from smollett himself who told good morning america gma last week that he suspected a surveillance camera caught the whole incident speaking to gmas robin roberts smollett said and i looked up and i saw there was a camera directly on the light post that is in the intersection so im like there it is and then the detective told me that the camera inside of the casing was facing north so they didnt have it and that was disappointing that detail appears to stick in his craw later in the interview unprompted he brings it up again the camera facing north how is that my issue if these brothers are telling the truth that the attack was pre planned smollett may have arranged for it to take place in a location where he assumed it would be recorded and one can imagine had there been surveillance footage of the attack the investigation would have proceeded very very differently once police had the footage it would leak once cable and network news had the footage it would loop endlessly the fact that the two brothers are black wouldnt matter cbs chicago reports that a black face mask was found in their apartment smollett told police the attackers wore face masks with those face masks the organized left the media democrats celebrities were allowed to assume his racist attackers were white if local media reports prove true and smollett did plan this its easy to see what he could have gained  had the altercation occurred in front of any of the other cameras he walked past that night first off he despises trump and it seems trumps supporters and this was an easy way to smear both especially in a world with a corrupt media that is always eager to spread any kind of fake news or hoax that makes trump or his supporters look evil there is also smolletts debut album which is scheduled to hit store shelves on march  and the live performances promoting the album which began just a few days after the attack overall it is just a fact that we now live in a media and entertainment culture where being a victim most especially a black and gay victim of racist trump supporters assures you endless news cycles worldwide fame and unearned status as americas conscience smollett may have not only believed his hoax would sell millions of albums but make him a civil rights hero  the kind of victim icon offered a prime speaking slot at the  democrat national convention a potent weapon relentlessly wielded by the media to pummel trump and his supporters take a step back though take a step back and look at the fire smollett was allegedly willing to play with imagine what it would have done to this country and to the city of chicago if the attack had been recorded if an outlet like tmz had leaked the video and if the wildly irresponsible race baiters at cnn had broadcast that video over and over and over again  an endless loop of two men assaulting a gay black man pouring bleaching on him and tying a noose around his neck it would have been just like that other media hoax  hands up dont shoot  and we all know what that led to the destruction of a predominantly black neighborhood

chinese communist party ccp mouthpiece the global times accused washington on tuesday of stirring up maritime trouble and threatened to prepare for regional military confrontations with the us in response to us secretary of state mike pompeos statement declaring beijings claims in the south china sea unlawful on monday the us state department formally endorsed a  international court ruling between the philippines and china declaring beijings maritime claims in the south china sea illegal beijing refuses to recognize the ruling and has continued to illegally lay claim to island territories maritime zones and offshore resources belonging to other southeast asian nations surrounding the disputed waters in recent months china has ramped up this bullying as pompeo referred to it monday while the world has been distracted by the ongoing chinese coronavirus pandemic the world will not allow beijing to treat the south china sea as its maritime empire america stands with our southeast asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights to offshore resources consistent with their rights and obligations under international law pompeo said responding to the statement on tuesday chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian said the us state department violated its governments commitment to not taking a position on the south china sea sovereignty issue deliberately stirred up territorial and maritime disputes and undermined regional peace and stability the us is the destroyer and troublemaker of peace and stability in the south china sea region zhao claimed military analysts warned the global times on tuesday that the chinese peoples liberation army pla has been preparing for military confrontations with the us in the sea the us will stir up more troubles incite more confrontations in the region and engage in more radical and dangerous moves in stirring up military conflicts with china and the chinese peoples liberation army pla has been preparing for conflicts in the south china sea and across the taiwan straits through military drills to improve its combat capability and information construction the south china sea is well within the grasp of the pla through effective strategic weapons as chinas generations of intercontinental ballistic missiles can fully cover the entire south china sea region zhuang guotu described by the global times as head of chinas xiamen universitys southeast asian studies center told the propaganda newspaper on tuesday this statement echoes a threat the global times issued to the us navy on july  when the us armed forces held their largest military drills in the south china sea in recent years deploying two aircraft carriers and a b  bomber to the region south china sea is fully within grasp of the pla any us aircraftcarrier movement in the region is at the pleasure of pla the ccp mouthpiece tweeted at the time china has the sufficient ability to defend its sovereign interests in the south china sea the ccp said through a global times editorial on tuesday the editorial further argues that the us aims not to support its southeast asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights as pompeo stated on monday but to use them as cannon fodder in a military conflict with china for best national interests asean association of southeast asian nations countries need to maintain balanced diplomacy between china and the us yet the latter always wants to cajole and coerce them to pick the us side it is to turn them into us cannon fodder as part of its strategy to contain china it wont succeed  we will not accept any country which uses us intervention as leverage to pressure and harm chinas interests reinforcing this claim that the us seeks to stir up  trouble with beijing in the south china sea the ccp argued in another article by the global times on tuesday that pompeos statement on monday means that washington is no longer pretending to remain neutral on territorial disputes in the waters it signals the us has decided to take a clear cut position and it wants a showdown with beijing on the issue whatever proactive measures the us carries out next china will display its reciprocal strategy to safeguard its sovereignty the ccp mouthpiece declared later describing specifically how the pla might respond to a us military threat in the region if the us launches military exercises in the waters be it without arms or live fire drills it can expect the very same scale in return  if the us warships come within  nautical miles of chinese soil  china

a texas school district hopes to incorporate facial recognition technology and tracking software into its current security suite this decision comes in response to the deadly high school shootings that happened in parkland florida and santa fe texas earlier this year the fort bend independent school district tasked a  member school safety advisory committee with evaluating security enhancements for their  campuses and  students at a june  board meeting the committee first proposed folding in this cutting edge technology to beef up its safety and security master plan if somebody makes a threat in the community we could plug their face in and if they pass in front of any of our cameras it would give us an alert right away said fort bend isd police chief david rider he gave the june presentation the committee comprised of students staff parents community members security experts and two fort bend isd trustees said facial recognition systems could identify sex offenders suspended or expelled students disgruntled former employees or anyone considered dangerous and alert police on a security camera at any campus or district facility the fort bend star reported rider called facial recognition software a preventable measure others are using while this kind of surveillance is more commonly used in airports and casinos and by law enforcement agencies other us school districts already approved adding high tech cameras and tracking software into their security protocols the magnolia school district in arkansas signed off on spending nearly  for a facial recognition system that serves two secondary schools the lockport city schools in upstate new york allocated  million from a  million  state grant to install  high tech facial recognition cameras on its eight campuses the niagara gazette reported lockport schools chose software developed by sn technologies known as aegis online the canadian tech company said it developed biometric applications to make the world a safer place and described security products designed for schools as to protect students and staff while on property they can also identify weapons however the new york chapter of the american civil liberties union nyclu criticized lockport schools the group called the software invasive and inaccurate suggesting it could wrongly identify students wkbw reported the nyclu filed a freedom of information act request for details from the school district on how and where they intended to use the software they also wanted to know who would have access to sensitive student data and if a third party could gain access to the system potentially putting this information at risk lockport superintendent michelle bradley responded that existing security camera footage remains stored on district servers for  days she said facial recognition technology would not alter ongoing protocols she indicated the upgraded technology would only issue an alert to school district officials if any recorded data matched an image entered into the system and flagged it as a potential security threat bradley said concerning individuals were sex offenders suspended or expelled students terminated employees and people with firearms she stated no third party vendor would have access to the data nyclu executive director donna lieberman disagreed with the districts security plan lockport is sending the message that it views students as potential criminals who must have their faces scanned wherever they go this will have a chilling effect on school climate throughout the district and sow distrust between students and school officials in texas the use of facial recognition technology could raise concerns over potentially increased data collection and impinged student privacy as well as overzealous zero tolerance policies that derail young lives onto the school to prison pipeline no single security measure will solve all the things we want to accomplish noted rider previously he said they had a multidisciplinary team in fact the fort bend isd proposed security upgrades specifically allocate  million to fencing around portable campus buildings metal detectors classroom door locks vehicles and hiring more campus police it also budgets in mandatory student id badges that can be bar coded to include student information for use in the lunchroom and library they may even contain health information other items under consideration by fort bend isd come from the school and firearm safety plan released by governor greg abbott they include arming school personnel already licensed to carry andor instituting a marshal program and the i watch texas app to anonymously report safety concerns the district may use civilian response to active shooter events crase training the fort bend newspaper noted rider said a mental health component would be part of their security plan to manage threats fort bend isd trustees expect to vote on the facial recognition system the other security items as well as on new school buses construction and renovations among other improvements at the august  board meeting if approved the entire referendum could total  billion according to the school board recap when district taxpayers vote in november follow merrill hope a member of the original breitbart texas team on twitter
presumptive republican nominee donald trump renewed his call to ban muslims from entering the united states from places that have been invaded by terrorists during his speech on monday afternoon in new hampshire i called for a ban after san bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many are saying i was right to do so  and although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on the ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country trump explained during his speech addressing the terrorist attack in orlando florida that killed roughly  people the immigration laws of the united states give the president the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the president deems detrimental to the interests or security of the united states as he deems appropriate i will use this power to protect the american people when i am elected i will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the united states europe or our allies until we understand how to end these threats after a full impartial and long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america he added we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer

fifth in a series most of us recognize that america is being pulled apart becoming more unequal we can add that this is not just the old split between workers and non workers instead increasingly its a split among workers yes theres a new elite namely those workers and owners connected to government favored industries such as tech and financeand to the government itself and then theres everyone else workers and owners involved in unfavored industries if that seems like a lopsided numerical ratio between favored and unfavoredwell welcome to the crony ized america of  where theres only room for a few insiders and yet at the same time precisely because the skew is so large one can see that this inequality will causealready has causeda substantial political backlash as we can note today the rising anger over this yawning gap has fueled the presidential campaigns of both donald trump and bernie sanders indeed it takes the full righteous anger of just about everyone in both parties to bulk up the fury that we see in the pollsters right directionwrong track numbers which show an overwhelming more than  negative outcome  and so too this november the political implications are likely to be staggeringthat is really bad news for incumbents and perceptually at least its hard to think of anyone who is more of an incumbent than hillary clinton she who has been in and around the top echelons of the federal government for a quarter century and its also hard to think of anyone who has benefited more from the rigged system than bill and hillary meanwhile a new study from the economic innovation group eig reveals further numbers that are even more grotesquely startling the eig study derived from census bureau data did indeed uncover some astounding numbers in the report eig got right to it showing how economic growth through entrepreneurship was increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few the first and most unambiguously troubling finding is a collapse in the number of new firms in the economythat is new business startups the essence of entrepreneurial energy and the second almost as troubling finding the report added is the increasing geographic concentration of recovery era businesses and jobs into a smaller number of more populous counties the eig report broke down data from three different economic recoveries in three different decades the s the s and the s figure  shows the drastic falloff in new business formations by nearly two thirds from more than  in the   recovery dipping down to  in the   recoveryand then a sharp crash plummeting to  in the   recovery indeed the total number of firms in the us economy today lags below the levels of  in addition even these meager gains have been increasingly concentrated in only a few places and the losses have been distributed far more widely in the s just  percent of counties suffered a net decrease in the number of businesses by contrast in the s a full  percent of counties suffered a net loss if youre curious as to how your county fared take a look at figure  equally startling is the concentration of economic activity in a handful of lucky duck countiesjust  of them to be exact according to the report those  counties accounting for about one sixth of the total us population garnered half of all the economic growth in the country figure  provides a list of those elite counties here we can note something interesting if not surprising the accelerating trend toward economic stratification in the s it took  counties to add up to a total of half of all the economic growth in the country in the s it took fewer just  and today as we have seen it takes just  counties thats  counties we might note out of some  counties parishes and independent towns across the breadth of america so undeniably the benefits of growth are intensifying in a smaller and smaller number of areasand dissipating everywhere else yet why is this happening the eig report doesnt attempt to answer that question definitively but it makes a passing reference to the booming areas being more globally networked into the world more knowledge based and thus more likely to attract immigrants we might note that eig although headquartered in washington dc is silicon valley funded so it shouldnt be a surprise that its report includes a pitch for the valley favored policies of more immigration and more globalization in other words the report sums up the silicon valley conventional wisdom globalism is not only good but also inevitable and thus the implicit message to the rest of the country dont fight the power submit get with the program perhaps heartland america seeing that it is being economically bypassed will decide to give up that is folks in the heartland might conclude that they would rather switch than fight that is maybe nevada and arkansas and south carolina and michiganto name four loser statesmight choose to capitulate and decide that they need to globalize no matter what would that work economically for these places it seems doubtful but maybe theyll try anyway and start the process by throwing themselves open to mass immigration yet theres another way of thinking about the economic trends described in the eig report perhaps instead of simply passively going along with the trends eig describes the rest of the country could choose to fight not switch maybe folks on main street could demand their fair share of course some will immediately insist that theres nothing that can be done that everyone in the country must bow down to the secular sacredness of the free market but what if the free market isnt free what if the economic conditions we have in america today were not the result of some invisible hand but rather the result of the visible hand of political wheeling and dealing in fact as we consider the policies that led to this sudden economic concentration we can see that they were utterly deliberate enacted with full awareness as to their impact yes it was a conscious deliberationthe deliberate picking of winners and losersthat got us to this point how so lets look at three policy clusters first globalism the obvious fruit of nafta the wto and a dozen other trade dealsdeals which of course have aided the big port cities such as miami and los angeles both of which are in eigs top  meanwhile as for indiana and ohiowell we know what happened to those states and all their counties second financialism made possible by the rampant deregulation of the financial sector in recent decades culminating in the repeal of glass steagall in  and subsequently bolstered by the multi trillion dollar policy of quantitative easing over the last decade so obviously new york city made it into the top  and now the rest of the country is owned seemingly by some hedge funder managing his assets with a spreadsheet and an algorithm meanwhile of course the disappearance of locally owned banks means the disappearance of locally available capital for jobs and growth third the phenomenal growth of the internet and e commerce which was facilitated of course by many federal policies including the fcc mandated transfer of value from the phone companies to the internet companies and then to the decision to tax shelter online purchases from sales taxes so its no wonder that californias santa clara and san francisco counties are also listed in the top  so yes life has been good for investment bankers asset managers and app makers even as its been hard for just about everyone else yet theres a flaw in this happy yuppie techie world and that flaw is just this the resulting politics are not stable because so few are winning and so many are losing and in politics the majority rules we might consider those  winning counties are in just seven statesarizona california florida illinois nevada new york and texas those are mostly big states to be sure in electoral college terms they add up to  electoral votes thats a lot but as we know america has  states and those other  states possess a total of  electoral votes so to put it bluntly the losers outnumber the winners thus we can see the makings of a trump ian or sanders ian majority coalition of the frozen out demanding justice at this point we can pause to note two objections first some will protest that whats happening in the economy today like it or not is just the workings of the free market and the free market is sacrosanct but as we have seen it wasnt the free market that did thisit was the unfree market and even if it had been the workings of the free market at some point we must realize that the interests of the nation as a whole must come first contrary to what some ivory tower dwellers might wish america is not a theory it is a nation of  million flesh and blood citizens who have the god given right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness if you think america is just a theory then please explain how americans came to fight and die in such real world places as belleau wood and bastogneand explain where their rifles and tanks came from the second objection is stronger it argues frankly that even if the market is shafting ordinary americans well theres nothing to be done because the government is too inept to do anything about itand any attempt will only make things worse admittedly this is a strong critique in fact the us government especially in the last half century has been mostly grossly incompetent sometimes even outright malevolent theres no excuse to be made for the total folly of for example the war on povertyor the war in iraq yet a longer look at american history tells us a different and more hopeful story in the past at least the government has been a reliable engine of economic activity we can cite to name a few success stories the erie canal the transcontinental railroad the tennessee valley authority hoover dam the interstate highways cruise missiles and yes the internet this author has even cited the us department of agriculture today it might be the butt of jokes but once upon a time it was an effective agent for work based uplift and empowerment the pattern in other words seems to be that the government is more effective at hard hamiltonian projects that create work as opposed to soft great society type programs that create welfare and while theres never a guarantee that the promises of tough minded hamiltonianism wont degenerate into promiscuous welfarism we the people have the capacity to keep our eye on the ball if we want to so its likely that we can succeed in keeping the economic development effort robust if we really try just in the last few decades for example the federal government successfully introduced drones for the warfront as well as gps on the homefront so its not hopeless we can do better indeed given the downward slope of the last few decades if we want our country to continue we had better do better to put it another way its just common sense to have a plan to get everyone working and being productive and if that violates the tenets of a precious ideology well then its not in fact a very good ideology yes the american dream should be open to all those who are willing to work for it just as the policies that led to the concentration of wealth were deliberate theres no reason why the policies that would lead to un concentration couldnt be just as deliberate but first obviously we will need new leadership  part one of this series part two of this series part three of this series part four of this series comment count on this

hand conference moderator mark levin said on stage at the conference after it became apparent that rubio was not going to appear on stage where is he cruz just went up here  the conservative review conferenceorganizers tell me rubio canceled m before he was due to go up  alexandra jaffe ajjaffe february   rubios campaign offered an explanation fyi  because of a delay in todays schedule marco is unable to make the event below tonight senator tim scott and congressman trey gowdy attended to represent the campaign tomorrows schedule remains unchanged the rubio campaign said in a statement this is a final admission that marco rubio isnt even going to try compete for the votes of conservatives in south carolina or anywhere else and who can blame him rubio isnt a conservative said rick tyler a communications adviser to ted cruz instead rubio and his campaign would rather hide behind their deceptive campaign tactics and liberal record on amnesty for illegals and voting to nominate john kerry ajjaffe rubio turns tail and runs from cr convention not his crowd crconvention  rick tyler rickwtyler february   rubio likely would not have been well received at the convention according to breitbart reporter jordan schactel who is on the ground at the conference ted cruz ben carson and donald trump supporters were there in droves but there was little discernible enthusiasm for rubio cruz reportedly received a thunderous ovation when he took the stage according to john drogin the head of a pro cruz super pac tedcruz introduced at crconvention and crowd goes wild strong grassroots enthusiasm scprimary cruzcrew pictwittercomdooxiwppo  john drogin johndrogin february   the rubio campaign did not immediately return a request for comment rubio tim scott and pro rubio south carolina governor nikki haley did have time for a photo friendly trip to the beacon drive in in spartanburg sc thursday afternoon before the conference update a conservative review spokeswoman told breitbart news that rubio was scheduled to speak at  pm and sent former louisiana gov bobby jindal sen tim scott r sc and rep trey gowdy r sc to the event as well as several campaign staffers gowdy was supposed to introduce him moments before he was set to take the stage the spokeswoman said rubios team informed the conservative review team he would be late the conservative review team offered to adjust the schedule and do whatever it took to accommodate rubio so he could speak with the conservatives gathered there rubio eventually ended up not showing up at all rubios campaign is attempting to argue it sent gowdy and scott and jindal as surrogates to the event but the rule from conservative review set months ago was that campaigns couldnt send surrogates unless the candidate himself came the campaign of former florida gov jeb bush for instance asked to send a surrogate instead of him since hes doing the cnn town hall this evening and conservative review refused that as such to be consistent with the conservative reviews rules the organization also refused rubios surrogates jindal gowdy and scottthe spokeswoman saidsaid they left the event as well if rubio had actually showed up though they would have been allowed to introduce him update ii rep louie gohmert who criticized rubio directly before rubio was slated to speak told breitbart news that he made it clear to the conference crowd that rubio betrayed his tea party roots during the gang of  immigration debacle i think originally i was going to speak between marco rubio and carson i said im supposed to go after marco and the guy said marco needed to move until later so now hes going on before carson gohmert said well patrick i didnt mention his name i didnt mention any of his supporters i just pointed out that we were really excited because we had been fighting boehners amnesty and mccain schumers amnesty and we were so excited when we had a great tea party senator elected from florida and then he joined the gang of  bill i met with steve king and other house conservatives at least once a week sometimes in ted cruzs office sometimes on the house side and we were strategizing about how to slow the bill down i think the great work that ted cruz and mike lee did in slowing down the bill really paid off and dave brat got elected thankfully and thats when it finally died i didnt get into all that detail at the conference but i did point out that there was absolutely nothing that ted cruz ever did but help the cause of slowing the bill down gohmert would not speculate as to why rubio canceled on his speech right after his remarks referring to rubio well see i dont know i certainly dont want to speculate the old judge in me says you dont want to assume facts not in evidence gohmert said noting that steve king missed the event because his wife was taken to the hospital and perhaps rubio had a similar problem thankfully kings wife is doing fine amazingly all of those core group people who took a stand to get a new speaker they are all endorsing the same guy and that guy is ted cruz if you like boehner you probably wont like cruz update iii the campaign manager of former florida gov jeb bush is piling on saying that rubios decision to cut and run is proof hes incapable of serving as a commander in chief bush who sat down with breitbart news washington political editor

sign up for our newsletter another of hillary clintons talking points bites the dust and its the washington post that shoots it down with an analysis that found clinton herself was the author of  of the classified emails on her server clinton has long maintained she neither sent or received classified emails this was originally interpreted as a claim no sensitive material would be found on her server but once a huge volume of such material was discovered including top secret and beyond top secret documents the talking point mutated into a bit of lawyer style evasion clinton was now claiming she was not the author or final recipient of the email chains containing classified material  she just popped up in the middle of the conversations that was never a compelling argument since clintons creation of the bootleg email server was the key issue it wasnt particularly relevant if she was the originator of email chains that exposed classified material by improperly passing through her unsecure system and now according to the post even the rhetorical value of that talking point is gone because hillary clinton was the originator of some dangerous email chains the finding is the first accounting of the democratic presidential front runners personal role in placing information now considered sensitive into insecure email during her state department tenure clintons authorship of dozens of emails now considered classified could complicate her efforts to argue that she never put government secrets at risk in roughly three quarters of those cases officials have determined that material clinton herself wrote in the body of email messages is classified clinton sometimes initiated the conversations but more often replied to aides or other officials with brief reactions to ongoing discussions the analysis also showed that the practice of using non secure email systems to send sensitive information was widespread at the department and elsewhere in government thats a most unsettling discovery and its going to get much worse if clinton skates after taking the use of non secure email systems to the dizzying heights of irresponsibility by setting up her own shadow mail server the post described classified information flying around on all sorts of non secure accounts including government email addresses much of this material was never supposed to leave the intelligence communitys highly secure sealed network the post strives mightily to give clinton the benefit of the doubt arguing that its analysis suggests that either material is being overclassified as clinton and her allies have charged or that classified material is being handled improperly with regularity by government officials at all levels  or some combination of the two the secretary of state is not authorized to unilaterally disregard security classifications from outside the state department  to the point where her aides were stripping the classification markings off the documents  because she thinks the intel community classifies too much material there is no way to maintain a functioning secret intelligence system if individuals believe their personal judgment overrides security protocols its just about the most dangerous idea anyone involved in a secure intelligence network could entertain clinton defenders also keep returning to the idea of retroactive classification meaning some of the documents were ok to send in the clear when clinton and her aides did it but were classified later thats not true of many of the documents weve seen so far and many more have been redacted so heavily that its difficult to tell what they contained also some of the material clinton treated irresponsibly was born classified meaning everyone involved was expected to know it should be treated as restricted information from the moment of inception it doesnt matter when a born classified document was marked up with the codes designating it secret information everyone who handles those documents most definitely including the secretary of state is responsible for knowing the nature of the material makes it classified immediately the washington post touches on that issue when her use of a private system was first revealed she told reporters i did not email any classified material to anyone on my email at other points she has said that none of the emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them  a point she reiterated friday in a cnbc interview but government rules require senders of classified information to properly mark it and the inspector general for the intelligence community has said that some of clintons correspondence contained classified material when it was sent  even if it was not labeled the state department has sidestepped the question spokesman john kirby said only that the departments reviewers focused on whether information needs to be classified today  prior to documents being publicly released state officials have not offered an assessment of whether the information was classified when it was sent much of the post article is devoted to quotes from officials eager to cut clinton slack by saying they didnt think the redacted material in messages they authored would have merited classification at the time they sent it although even these officials note they thought they were working on a reasonably secure government system not a secret server in clintons basement and complained the email scandal was making the general public privy to conversations they otherwise would not have seen foreign intelligence services certainly werent meant to see these emails either especially in the complete and unredacted form they would have obtained by hacking clintons eminently hackable private server the associated press notes that clinton and her aides often appeared keenly aware of the limitations of operating over an unclassified nongovernment account and were sometimes frustrated by the constraints even as the fbi works on determining whether laws were broken theres no question hillary clintons extremely poor judgment interfered with the responsibilities of her office violated numerous protocols and dragged many other government officials party to those violations without their knowledge all because she supposedly couldnt manage the inconvenience of carrying two smartphones

president but thats not really the headline the headline is that on core conservative issues not political issues like legislation before the congress but on foundational questions about life and children and what happens when you die no one with a national platform has been more honest or sincere or effective than kanye west has been maybe in generations its all pretty shocking really talk about an unlikely messenger but its real check out wests twitter feed if you havent seen it not everything he says is conservative far from it not everything he says is even intelligible but when west talks about his faith and about the gift of human life you start to ask yourself why arent there any elected republicans who sound like that they say they believe the same things but if they actually do why dont they talk like kanye west does and the answer of course is because theyre afraid to but west is not afraid he doesnt have to be he is too famous he has made too much money he sold something like  million albums over the past  years and really its hard to cancel a guy like that so what is the left do in response to kanye west how do you make kanye west shut up the short answer is you cant so you work to discredit him you go ad hominem you ignore what hes saying you attack him as a person you dont engage with his ideas you know you would lose if you tried that so instead you try to keep people from listening to him its an easier job when youre dealing with less famous people thanks to our centrally controlled internet the left can usually silence dissent in an instant with a press of a button but with prominent wrong thinkers like kanye west censorship requires a finer touch more artistic flair when the author jk rowling had the gall to note that biological sex is a physical reality not just a state of mind google couldnt simply wipe her off the internet shes jk rowling she created harry potter so the left had to destroy her more methodically one british news site compared rowling to the anti semite richard wagner and then dismissed her as quote deeply unpleasant so multiply that attack by hundreds of stories and over time they are confident and maybe theyre right that no one will ever listen to jk rowling again in kanye wests case they decided to attack him as mentally ill you hear that a lot now but its a relatively new tactic it was just a little over four years ago that cnn published a piece about kanye west they highlighted his most famous moments like the time he interrupted taylor swift at the mtv video music awards cnn described all these incidents as quote controversial but there was no mention of kanye west being a danger to himself much less mentally ill no just controversial not a problem and then west appeared to say something positive about donald trump and everything changed in an instant kanye west became a babbling lunatic the kind of guy who pulls imaginary insects out of the air and soils his own pants a total nutcase watch begin video clip unidentified male kanye wests event on sunday and you saw  unidentified female right unidentified male  at least i saw him and clearly in trouble unidentified male voice over we met david bowen a democratic state representative earlier this summer bowen telling cnn its sad to see a popular music artist like kanye be used as a pawn to trick his own people and fans john berman cnn anchor so new questions this morning about kanye wests mental health after this tweetstorm and so called campaign rally bakari sellers cnn political commentator you see that ignorance and asinine thought and behavior has been something thats risen to the top unidentified female whether a clearly vulnerable mr west is being used to try to siphon votes away from joe biden end video clip carlson theyre sad theyre concerned hes in trouble oh its also fake the feigned concern the oily fake empathy kanye is vulnerable right these people are actually worried but theyre not worried about kanye west or his family they dont care about them theyre worried about the threat that west poses to democratic party orthodoxy and therefore to their power they dont say that out loud theyre liars so instead they continue to play the role of psychiatric nurse heres the guy whose job it is to get drunk on camera on new years eve letting kanye west know that he is embarrassing himself and his dead mother begin video clip don lemon cnn anchor what i saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself and embarrassing americans but mostly african americans and now all of a sudden he is the person who represents the african american community he doesnt this was an embarrassment kanyes mother is rolling over in her grave end video clip carlson he is defiling the memory of his mother sad youll notice that this group of cable news mental health experts may be deeply concerned about kanye west and yet for all of their apparent medical training somehow they dont appear to notice that joe biden can no longer speak english joe is fine he is not embarrassing anyone kanye west by contrast is deeply embarrassing to them mostly because he is embarrassing to the democratic party here is someone who should be a democrat calling out the most absurd lie that party tells we care about black lives thats why we want more abortion clinics in black neighborhoods thats their position it is insultingly stupid and anyone who thinks about it knows that when you love your kids you want them to grow up and have children of their own its the main thing you want but if your most consistent message to your children was please end your pregnancy they might start to wonder how you really felt about them and kanye west has started to wonder about that and things like that last month on twitter west wrote that he had quote cried at the thought of aborting my firstborn im concerned for the world that feels you shouldnt cry about this subject thats for sure its obvious but when kanye west says it people might actually listen to him and thats a massive problem for the left here he is last month begin video clip kanye west artist my mom saved my life my dad wanted to abort me my mom saved my life there would have been no kanye west because my dad was too busy i almost killed my daughter i almost killed my daughter end video clip carlson when was the last time you heard someone famous say something like that in public lets see never and then west went on to point out some of the more inconvenient facts that the progressive left wants you to forget quote over  black babies have been aborted over the past  years west tweeted see the media said hes not well pray for him of course what west said was factually true whats also true is that planned parenthood was founded by someone who wanted fewer black people thats why she founded planned parenthood her name was margaret sanger and she once wondered aloud about the appearances of quote exterminating the negro population end quote its disgusting you can find that on google west has he knows it and learning it clearly made him rethink his worldview here he is from a couple of years ago begin video clip west one of the moves that i love that liberals try to do a liberal would try to control a black person through the concept of racism because they know that we are a very proud emotional people so when i said i like trump to like someone thats liberal theyll say oh but hes racist you think racism can control me oh that dont stop me thats an visible wall end video clip carlson oh no wonder they hate him now to be clear kanye west is not a normal person and were not saying he is he has said out loud he sometimes suffers from something he calls a sprained brain were not sure what that is were not pretending to be mental health experts and maybe kanye west is crazy we dont know but its also true and wise people know this that at a time like this a lunatic time sometimes it is only the crazy people who can see the world clearly follow jeff poor on twitter jeffpoor please let us know if you re having issues

sign up for our newsletter   hillary clinton co founded the senate india caucus which anti offshoring advocates say champions issues important to india including outsourcing and h b and l  visas   clinton in  i am delighted to be the senator from punjab as well as from new york   clinton has called for nearly doubling the controversial h b guest worker programsuggesting that american workers lack the skills to fill american jobs she has also defended the cheap labor practices of an indian outsourcing firm to which the clinton foundation has financial ties we are not against all outsourcing we are not in favor of putting up fences she said   shortly after the ceo of hclthe indian firm that helped lay off  american disney workers in orlando called american tech graduates unemployable bill clinton delivered a speech to hcl to the tune of nearly a quarter of a million dollars at disney world in orlando   reports note that clinton has repeatedly telegraphed her support for a globalized world to the indian community at a conference of  indian americans bill clinton extolled the virtues of open borders easy travel easy immigration   in  barack obama slammed hillary clinton d punjabs personal financial and political ties to india its all about the money his campaign wrote at a  fundraiser hillary clinton jokingly told donors that she could easily see herself as the elected representative of foreign citizens in the indian region of punjab sign up for our newsletter as india abroad reported at the time at the fundraiser hosted by dr rajwant singh at his potomac maryland home clinton began by joking that i can certainly run for the senate seat in punjab and win easily after being introduced by singh as the senator not only from new york but also punjab it was apparently a line clinton used more than once the sikh council writes that at a  event in the us senate clinton said i am delighted to be the senator from punjab as well as from new york the statement prompted the campaign of her then opponent sen barack obama to call the new york senator hillary clinton d punjab in a memo circulated to reporters implying that clinton represents foreign nations and foreign citizens rather than her own american constituents the memo was titled hillary clinton d punjabs personal financial and political ties to india and it extensively detailed clintons willingness to put the needs and interests of foreign corporations and foreign workers in india ahead of the needs of the american people the obama campaign wrote the clintons have reaped significant financial rewards from their relationship with the indian community both in their personal finances and hillarys campaign fundraising hillary clinton who is the co chair of the senate india caucus has drawn criticism from anti offshoring groups for her vocal support of indian business and unwillingness to protect american jobs hillary clinton has taken tens of thousands of dollars from companies that outsource jobs to india workers who have been laid off in upstate new york might not think that her recent joke that she could be elected to the senate seat in punjab is that funny indeed while these revelations have received scant to virtually no coverage by corporate media this election cycle clinton has an astonishingly long record of promoting indian corporations and foreign workers at the direct expense of american workers most notably clinton has extensive ties to corporations responsible for some of the most egregious anti american worker labor practices namely the india based tata consultancy services tcs and hcl these india based it firms specialize in outsourcing and offshoring and are among the top h b and l  visa employers in the united states together hcl and tata have stolen tens of thousands of us jobs from american workers all across the country hcl and tata are responsible for the layoffs of workers from disney southern california edison northeast utilities xerox university of california siemens and countless others a review of clintons record shows that she has not only defended and enabled these corporations anti american worker business model but she has also pushed to expand it calling for substantial increases to the number of low wage workers admitted on guest worker visas and suggesting that american workers lack the requisite skills to fill us jobs interestingly both companies have given money to the clintons either via donations to the clinton foundation or paying bill clinton to deliver speeches as the obama campaign wrote in  about clintons ties to india its all about the money tata as the washington post has reported tata has given tens of thousands of dollars to the clinton foundation although foreign nationals cannot contribute to us campaigns clinton has won campaign support from the indian american community records show tata consultancy services contributed between  and  to the clinton foundation and ratan tata then chairman of the tata group was a speaker at the clinton global initiative conference in  tata is also a participant in the clinton foundations stem education program the clintons ties to the indian corporation extend back for over a decade in  then senator hillary clinton was widely credited for recruiting and helping tata open a software development center in buffalo new york as a press release issued by tata announcing the opening stated the deal was the brainchild of senator hillary rodham clinton a year before the announcement clinton had courted executives from tata and other indian businessesgiving them a tour of the region clinton was so instrumental to the deal that the company even flew her to buffalo to join tatas ceo subramaniam ramadorai for the announcement of the companys opening even at the time clintons decision was a controversial one five days before clinton and tata announced the buffalo opening tata came under fire for helping a siemens unit in lake mary florida lay off its american workers and forced them to train their lower wage foreign replacements brought in on guest worker visas as bloomberg reported less than a week before the announcement of tatas buffalo opening siemens made no bones about the cost cutting nature of the layoff bloomberg noted that one of the foreign replacements who speaks halting english allegedly earned just one third of the original american employees  a year salary yet despite public outrage over siemens and tatas anti american worker business model clinton forged ahead with tatas opening in buffalo the event signaled that clinton who portrays herself as a fighter for american workers had aligned herself with indian american business leaders and indian companies feared by the labor movement the los angeles times reported in  mike emmons one of the american siemens workers who was axed and replaced by a foreign worker said that he was in touch with clintons staff as all of this was happening yet shortly after emmons had reached out to senator clinton seeking representation and protection for his colleagues from tatas job theft emmons was forced to watch as clinton celebrated tata at its grand opening in buffalo in july of  emmons decided to speak out in response to clintons claim that she finds it heartbreaking when american workers are forced to train their foreign replacements in an op ed titled dont believe clintons crocodile tears over lost american jobs emmons denounced clintons preference for foreign guest workers over qualified americans emmons pointed specifically to clintons long history of supporting expansions to the h b program and her support for legislation that would have weakened the already laughably feeble protections currently in place to prevent americans from being displaced by guest workers for me the issue is personal i am a tech worker who was replaced by a foreign guest worker emmons wrote emmons said that as he struggled to afford medical care for his handicapped daughter and as he watched his former colleagues struggle to make ends meet he decided i could not remain silent i reached out to elected office holders across the country including hillary clinton who had been elected senator from new york in  shortly after i reached out to senator clintons office i saw that she attended the grand opening of a tata regional office in buffalo new york if hillary clinton truly was heartbroken about americans being forced to train their foreign replacements she had ample opportunity to do something about it when she was in office i for one have good reason not to trust that she will do the right thing if elected president tata has been responsible for destroying tens of thousands of american jobs and depressing the wages of countless more said it labor expert and howard university professor ron hira who was a professor at the rochester institute of technology at the time of tatas opening in buffalo hira said that clintons actions enabled tatas anti american worker business model these guest workers are imported by tata because they are cheaper than american workers over the ten year period fy  tata imported an incredible  h b guest workers we dont know how many l  workers it imported but its likely more than  thats at least  jobs that american workers should have been hired for or in many cases were already doing workers at siemens northeast utilities and southern california edison and got replaced by an h b worker those are high wage jobs that pay more than k to american workers why would anyone court a company whose business model is based upon destroying american jobs its the height of irrationality to think that destroying american jobs is effective economic development policy by giving tata her repeated endorsements she enabled these very practices indeed in a  interview with then cnn host lou dobbs clinton defended tatas controversial practices insisting that they brought jobs to buffalo well of course i know that they outsource jobs that theyve actually brought jobs to buffalo theyve created  jobs in buffalo she said you know outsourcing does work both ways it expert and uc davis professor norm matloff mocked clinton for her remarks yeah  whole jobs matloff wrote at the time tata imports thousands of h bs and offshores untold numbers of jobs but hey they created  new jobs in the us matloff further pointed out that it was unknown whether those  whole jobs were even given to american workers noting that tata may very well have filled those  jobs with h bs most remarkably during her interview with dobbs clinton declared we are not against all outsourcing we are not in favor of putting up fences her remarks were reported by the times of india in an article titled clinton stands up for tata outsourcing during a  trip to india clinton again reportedly defended the tata deal insisting that it represented the type of cooperation that would help prevent the kind of negative feelings that could be stirred up by by critics of globalization while on foreign soil she called critics of the global marketplace presumably american workers who have been victims of globalization short sighted around the same time clinton was pushing policies that would expand the displacement of american workers in  clinton backed ted kennedys immigration plan which would have nearly doubled the cap on h b visas per year in  clinton specifically called for increasing the pool of foreign workers available to corporate employers i also want to reaffirm my commitment to the h b visa program and to increase the current cap clinton reportedly told a conference of indian workers in silicon valley whom she addressed via satellite foreign skilled workers contribute to greatly to our us technological development clinton told the group in contrast to the foreign skilled workers clinton said she wants to import to the us clinton suggested that americans workers lack the necessary skills to fill us jobs without citing any evidence to support her argumentand indeed disregarding all of the evidence that would prove her statement to be demonstrably falseclinton suggested that american workers skills are not in line with the jobs theres no shortage of talented hardworking people in the united stateswe just need to get the skills more in line with the jobs clinton said amid her call for increasing the importation of foreign workers this statement is remarkable given the fact that the american workers who tata replacedworkers like mike emmons at siemensalready had skills that were in line with the job they were filling in fact the american workers already filling those jobs were more skilled than their foreign replacements as evidenced by the fact that the american workers had to spend weeks training their foreign lower wage replacements experts have shown that theres actually a surplus of labor in the tech labor market and have explained that this the reason it workers have not seen a pay raise since bill clintons administration despite these realities clinton chose to parrot the debunked talking point that there is a shortage of skilled laborers while addressing a conference of silicon valley employers in  clinton told the crowd that if elected president she would address the concerns of silicon valley ceos who want a larger pool of foreign workers i have had countless meetings with people from the silicon valley and in silicon valley bemoaning the shortage in the skills that are needed clinton said clinton said that across the country there are jobs that american workers are not fillingnot just tech jobs but blue collar jobs as well clinton suggested that this is because workers do not have the skills for the jobs i hear that across the country there are auto mechanic jobs we cannot fill today thousands of them making    thousand dollars there are airline mechanic jobs that we cant fill  there are so many jobs that we cant get the right mix between the person and the skill and the job we need to do more and we have to also recognize the shortage that exists now clinton added so i am reaffirming my commitment to the hb visa and increasing the current cap lets just face the fact that foreign skilled workers contribute greatly to what we have to do in being innovatorsyes increase the cap interestingly despite the fact that clinton has struggled to defend her controversial support for doubling h b visas in the past computer worlds patrick thibodeau notes that in this election the h b visa is not mentioned in her immigration platform her tech policy platform or in the just released draft platform for the democratic party hcl in addition to tata clinton is also tied to hcl the firm that helped disney world in orlando florida lay off  american tech workers and forced them to train their lesser skilled foreign replacements brought in on h b visas interestingly bob iger the disney ceo who presided over the firing and replacement of hundreds of american workers is also a hillary clinton supporter in august iger hosted a big ticket hollywood fundraiser for clinton at the home of billionaire entertainment mogul haim saban in beverly park a gated community above beverly hills iger serves as a co chair of an open borders lobbying firm that has advocated for the type of expansions to the foreign worker h b program that clinton has championed the disney workers who suffered h b job theft are planning on filing a discrimination lawsuit against disney based on the contract between disney and hcl the disney workers attorney told breitbart that they made discrimination claims under the title vii of the civil rights act the claims include discrimination based on national origin the displaced workers were americannon indian while their replacements were reportedly indian nationals indeed in  hcl caused a stir when its chief executive vineet nayar said that american tech grads are unemployable as daily tech reported at the time mr nayar speaking before an audience of business partners in new york city blasted american tech grads as unemployable he elaborated that he views american tech grads as inferior to those from india china and brazil as the americans only want to get rich and dream up the next big thing he says students from countries like india china and brazil are more willing to put the effort into boring details of tech process and methodology mr nayar also complains about the cost of training americans he says that most americans are simply too expensive to train the comments sparked outrage amongst the american tech community yet just a few months after hcls then ceo described american tech graduates as inferior to indian tech grads former president bill clinton accepted an invitation to speak at the company for a hefty fee after nayars anti american tech worker comments clinton ultimately wound up delivering two paid speeches to hcl for a total of  the first speech was in april of  and the second was in november of  clinton delivered his november  to hcl at disney world in orlando florida almost exactly three years later  american workers at that very same location at disney world in orlando florida were informed that they would be replaced with indian workers that hcl had helped bring into the country on h b visas as one employee explained the american workers were gathered together at a meeting with a top disney executive many of the workers who had been described as top performers thought the meeting was to recognize their contributions to the company or was about a potential promotion or a bonus of some kind some employees even thought the company was throwing them a surprise party instead the disney executive reportedly informed them all of you in this room will be losing your jobs in the next  days your jobs have been given over to a foreign workforce in the meantime you will be training your replacements until your jobs are  percent transferred over to them and if you dont cooperate you will not receive any severance pay tears streamed down employees faces others completely broke down and were crying out loud one employee was murmuring no this cant be as they were marched out of the room ninety days later as one employee found himself living on unemployment payments he spoke of the sleepless nights that accompanied the pressure of trying to provide for food and shelter for his family he spoke of the feeling of alienation that accompanied the huge influx of foreign workers whose presence transformed the composition of the company overnight a foreign language was suddenly being spoken throughout the building hallways the worker said he said he felt betrayed and described the humiliating disgraceful and demoralizing experience as he had no choice but to watch a foreign worker completely take over my job ive spoken to thousands of american families whose lives have been destroyed by this business model said the disney workers attorney sara blackwell who runs an organization that represents high skilled american workers who have been replaced by low wage foreign guest workers american workers tend to have a very emotional reaction to being forced to train their replacements blackwell explained they know that they are being sold out and they feel as though they are contributing to the death of the american tech workforce by training their replacements but theyve been forced to do it in order to get their severance pay which they need so that they can pay their mortgage and feed their families workers tell me that they feel physically sick as theyre forced to train their replacements they go home and vomit they cry every single night they go into counseling theyre admitted to hospitals there are divorces weve seen two suicides as a result of these cheap labor practices and when the workers are officially let go and cant find work that kind of emotional distress drives a lot of them to homelessness a lot of them move in with their older parents it has single handedly destroyed american families by the thousands hillary clinton is by far the worst person we could have in the white house blackwell added if hillary wins there will be no protections for these american workers they will have no voice indias favorite senator the obama campaign memo hitting clintons ties to india also emphasized that in  clinton co founded and became the co chair of the senate india caucus which was coordinated by the us india political action committee usinpac according to the los angeles times the usinpac cites the tata deal as one of clintons top three achievements as a senator and evidence of a turnabout in its view from her past criticism of outsourcing even though she was against outsourcing at the beginning of her political career the usinpac website says she has since changed her position and now maintains that offshoring brings as much economic value to the united states as to the country where services are outsourced especially india information technology professionals association of america itpaa an anti offshoring advocacy group that labeled clinton a weasel in  for her embrace of anti american worker labor practicesdescribed clintons india caucus as a group of senators that supports issues important to india including outsourcing and h b and l  visas a blog post on the cwa unions website warned that clintons india caucus represents the first time in the history of the us senate that a country focused caucus has been constituted the cwa post urged readers to check if your us senator is a member of the caucus if yes write and object to the h b visa program and offshore outsourcing of american jobs indeed as the los angeles times reported in her effort to woo wealthy indian americans donors clinton has repeatedly telegraphed her support for a globalized world including the benefits of open borders and outsourcing clinton is successfully wooing wealthy indian americans many of them business leaders with close ties to their native country and an interest in protecting outsourcing laws and expanding access to worker visas her campaign has held three fundraisers in the indian american community recently one of which raised close to  million its sponsor told an indian news organization her campaign continues to telegraph  sometimes in front of indian american audiences  that she sees benefits to a globalized world three weeks ago her husband drew applause at a conference of  indian americans in washington as he extolled the benefits of open borders easy travel easy immigration he said the outsourcing debate bothered him because it failed to acknowledge the contributions of indians who settled in the us the same day he headlined a fundraiser at the conference for his wifes campaign while then senator obamawho as president pushed policies to expand the displacement of american workers through large scale foreign worker programseventually apologized for the memos caustic tone his campaigns message was unmistakably clear a hillary clinton presidency would not represent the interests of american workers but would instead represent the desires of wealthy donors and foreign corporations while clintons record on these issues were apparently a topic of discussion during the  election it is perhaps interesting that in the  electionwhich has been so driven by the issues of trade immigration national sovereignty and opposition to globalization clintons history on this issue has received so little attention it remains to be seen whether clinton will be asked about her controversial positions on these subjects during next weeks

turkish border forces have begun shooting syrians as they make their way across the border according to a local human rights organisation the country has previously been criticised for allowing free illegal movement across its borders the change of policy is thought to be a response to western demands to do more to curb terrorist movements and fight islamic state the london based syrian observatory for human rights sohr has documented sixteen deaths including three children at the hands of turkish border officers over the last four months the times has reported however a local smuggler from the border town of kilis has told the paper that the true number is thought to be higher as those who fall on the syrian side of the border are dragged back into the country to be buried within the war torn country the lucky ones he added are those who are injured on the turkish side of the border as they are taken to turkish hospitals and allowed to stay among the cases documented by sohr are that of a man and his child who were shot at ras al ain about  miles to the north east of raqqa on the syrian turkish border in february a month later in early march two migrants were shot crossing the border at guvveci which lies on the western stretch of the border the smuggler told the times that people still cross the border but now they will either be killed or captured at the height of his trade he was making  a week shuttling illicit cigarettes hashish and people back and forth across the border now he says business has completely dried up now i am searching for a job he said maybe ill open a clothes shop the smuggling trade is finished ankara has come under sustained criticism by the west for allowing her southern border to remain so porous for so long over the last few years millions of pounds worth of goods  cigarettes drugs oil cars and weapons  have been crossing the border in both directions but western governments are far more concerned about the constant flow of people since  syrians have been able to cross the border without passports while the government has turned a blind eye to the thousands of foreign nationals streaming in and out of syria in support of islamic state now europe wants to see results on stopping the flow of migrants northwards while america is demanding action on the fight against the jihadis a concrete border fence has gone up to replace flimsy rolls of barbed wire and more security forces have been drafted in the recent capture of ten islamic state fighter along with a cache of weapons was lauded in the turkish media as an example of the policys success according to the times it was americas threats to use the ypg  kurdish militia  to take back islamic states last remaining border stronghold which enraged turkish president recep tayyip erdoan and prompted him to crack down on illicit border crossings at a private dinner in washington earlier this week erdoan ripped into the white houses regional policy slamming their support for kurdish fighters in syria while american analysts consider the kurds their most valuable proxies in the ground battle against islamic state turkey views them as terrorists aligned with the militant group the kurdistan workers party pkk who want autonomy he kept coming back to that issue terrorists are terrorists  there are no good ones one attendee of the dinner speaking on condition of anonymity told foreign policy he pretty much threw the administration under the bus but the shootings also pose serious problems for european leaders who have recently struck a deal with turkey which recognises it as a safe third country meaning refugees can be returned there without fear of persecution they want to be able to return migrants who have travelled from turkey to greece by sea in exchange from migrants living in camps within turkey time will tell whether the solution will prove to be palatable to liberalised european leaders please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

wednesday on her new podcast former first lady michelle obama called coronavirus an opportunity to think about how wealth is distributed to lower income essential workers obama noted the power that would enable what we could do to allow such actions journalist michele norris said theres kind of a new covid vocabulary isnt it there are also words that have always had some meaning but that take on different meaning now the word hero the word essential she continued i think we will forever think about the word essential in a different way and when we were told to stay home they got up got dressed and went out into the world risking their lives to drive garbage trucks to work in warehouses to work in grocery stores to work in hospitals often doing invisible but yes essential work and i struggle with it because im not sure that we treat them like theyre essential obama replied and thats something that we need to thats a part of that reflection that we need to do you know with ourselves and and as a community and we have to think about that in terms of how wealth is distributed you know how how these essential people are supported and what does that mean a lot of these people are broke they dont have health insurance that it if they were to get sick as essential as they are we have not as a society deemed it essential to make sure that they can go to the doctor and get the care that they need and even if they can get covid care even if they can get tested to keep working and doing our stuff after the effects of the virus have worn off and they are dealing with some lung issue or some breathing issue or asthma that they dont have to wait in a an emergency room for hours on end and then worry that they can even afford the prescription medication that they need to survive i mean we have to think about this we have to think about the people who are not from this country who are essential workers a lot of those folks are still out in the fields picking our corn and making sure that that food is in our grocery stores and working in these meatpacking plants to ensure that the that the cow that was slaughtered gets into our bellies later in the podcast obama said its not enough to just acknowledge that the pain exists to acknowledge the struggle we actually have power we can we can change so much of what we do we can sacrifice a little more we can we can shift priorities uh and not just in our own lives cause its not enough to just do it in your own life if youre not willing to do it in our broader policy you know if that if that if those conversations arent going to happen then were just giving lip service to it you know she added weve seen these times in our history before not just like this but but but when things are good its easy to forget about that to take it for granted to start thinking yeah how much do i really want my taxes going to that and school lunches eh you know thats a lot of money what does it matter  lets cut this lets chop that but all of that came all the things that we look to cut were put in place in response to some crisis that revealed to us that hey there are a lot of hungry kids at home because their parents are poor so whats the best way to feed them were going to provide them with nutrition at school so we we have it in our countrys dna to step up she concluded always with great opposition because youre asking people to sacrifice to give up things that that they think they deserve that theyre entitled to for the sake of the greater good follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen

sign up for our newsletter a just released poll shows that donald trumps campaign trail immigration and labor policies have overwhelming public support and strong opposition from just one sixth of voters the ipsos poll shows that only about one in six americans strongly oppose trumps policies towards immigrant labor repatriations sanctuary cities islamic migrants employer oversight and his ground breaking proposal to reduce legal immigration sign up for our newsletter trumps labor and immigration policies are strongly backed by an average  percent of the respondents and are somewhat supported by another  percent that is an average support of almost  percent versus strong opposition of just  percent roughly  percent did not answer the questions ipsos is a highly rated polling firm but conducted the poll in september and hid the pro trump answers until nov  a week after the election the poll shows the strong support and somewhat support numbers for various policies that is important because those details help explain americans contradictory desire to help their kids and also help foreign migrants the strong and somewhat numbers also show how many americans might take action if a controversial policy is implemented or cancelled trumps promise to start immediately deporting illegals who have committed crimes gets  percent strong and somewhat support and only  percent strong opposition thats  to one support sixty two percent support and  percent strongly oppose detaining or immediately deporting all people who enter the us illegally sixty seven percent of respondents support and only  percent strongly oppose the implementation of current laws that levy fines on employers who hired illegals instead of americans those laws were largely ignored by president barack obama and president george w bush the poll shows that trumps revised plans to minimize the danger of immigrant islamic terrorism is backed by  percent and strongly opposed by  percent that result echoes the publics strong opposition to islamic doctrines the most significant result in the poll however is the strong support for reductions in legal immigration which amounted in  to roughly one new immigrant for every two americans entering the workforce or one immigrant for every two american births the poll showed that only  percent strongly opposed plans to change the legal immigration system to limit legal immigration four times as many or  percent back reductions in legal immigration while  percent did not take a position on the campaign trail trump called for a two year pause in legal immigration i think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see just to answer the second part of your question where we are where we stand whats going on  id say a minimum of one year maybe two years he said in march  any significant reduction in immigration would raise americans salaries and wages cut welfare spending reduce housing costs and drop unemployment according to recent studies by a wall street advisory group that backed hillary clinton and by the national academies of sciences more importantly a major reduction in immigration would force democrats to give up their  year strategy of gaining political dominance by importing government dependent poor workers and voters without a future wave of immigrant voters democrats would be forced to offer policies that are favored by a broad swath of ordinary blue collar americans  and the democrats business allies would be forced to divert profits back into wages and training programs many polls show that most americans do like immigrants and they want to be seen liking immigration  but they also want a reduction in the annual immigration of  million people which cuts salaries for the  million americans who enter the job market each year prior to the election trumps campaign manager recognized that americans are far more likely to openly oppose immigration when they are asked if companies should be allowed to hire immigrants instead of americans this same outspoken response is also visible in a pre election poll of the midwesterners who gave trump his election winning state victories and of latinos who mostly prioritize the economy over additional immigration of their ethnic group on nov  actual election results from counties with large latino populations suggests that trump probably did no worse than gov mitt romney among latinos and probably did better said harry enten a data analyst at fivethirtyeightcom these disparate views of americans are highlighted in the ipsos poll by unusually strong opposition to trumps campaign trail promise to extend the wall along the us mexico border overall  percent strongly or somewhat supported building a wall while  percent strongly opposed a wall said the poll but this response from the  adult respondents is likely influenced by party solidarity because it was conducted sept  to sept   during the political campaign where trumps main theme was construction of a border wall that party solidarity could explain why so many democrats disagree with trumps main campaign trail promise to build a wall  but also support trumps lower profile proposals to restrict the movement of illegal immigrants such as a crackdown on employers that hire illegals similarly  percent of the polls respondents strongly opposed cancellation of the obamas  quasi amnesty for younger illegals who are called dreamers by democratic advocates when asked if they support or oppose ending the executive orders that protect people who were brought to the us illegally when they were children  percent said they were strongly opposed and  percent said they strongly support the proposal overall  percent of americans support an end to the amnesty while  percent somewhat or strongly oppose ending the amnesty but when the same question is asked without any reference to children support for repatriations spikes and opposition crashes sixty two percent support  and only  percent strongly oppose  detaining or immediately deporting all people who enter the us illegally thats four to one support for enforcing immigration laws the publics conflicting answers may also be caused by the polls lack of information about the scale and economic impact of current immigration comment count on

dutch freedom party pvv leader geert wilders has made an impassioned plea for western patriots to stand up and reject hatred and terrorism in the wake of several islamist terror attacks mr wilders has accused western governments of being dangerously blind to the dangers of islamisation reeling off a list of recent terror attacks and calling for an end to muslim migration he said western governments remain dangerously blind to the danger of islamization islam is a religion of peace they say but that is a lie look at what happened at istanbul look at what happened in orlando a few weeks ago look at what happened last march at brussels airport and metro station look at what happened at the bataclan theatre in paris last november look at what happened in san bernardino last december the list is endless and everything this list has in common is islam mr wilders moved to clarify his point remarking that while he believed that islam was a significant problem for the west individual muslims could be good people regardless he said no honest individual can say with a straight face that islam is a doctrine of peace of freedom outlining how he proposed to defend europe from radical islamism mr wilders said that a patriotic spring was on its way and remarked people often ask me what can be done and the answer is actually quite simple reject the fatalism islamisation is not inevitable the first thing we need to do is recognize that islam and nothing but islam is the cause of our problems and the next thing is to close our doors to islamic intolerance all immigration from islamic countries stressing the importance of integration of muslims into western society mr wilders said those who were willing to work to fit in could fit in could stay but those who wanted to create parallel islamic societies within the west would be better off going to nations which already catered to their needs he said those who are already here are welcome to stay if they live according to our laws and constitution but if they want to live according to sharia law they should go to places like saudi arabia where there are no elections and no freedom of speech where women and non muslims are inferior beings and where dissidents are jailed lashed are executed we are the opposite of that and we want to keep it that way more and more patriots all over the west are beginning to realize that it is the time to draw the line issuing a call to arms mr wilders concluded the patriot spring is on its way people want their country back they and want to preserve their freedom and security they dont want sharia law here they want to de islamize their societies my friends islam and freedom are incompatible so join us stand for freedom your own freedom the freedom of your children and grandchildren and defend the identity and civilization of the west geert wilders is a veteran campaigner for freedom in europe and is one of the best known counter islamification activists speaking to breitbart london earlier this month in the wake of a brutal islamist killing in paris he said ramadan is the deadliest time of the year we should acknowledge that islam is the problem islam and freedom are incompatible we must de islamize our western societies follow oliver lane on twitter follow oliverlane or e mail to olanebreitbartcom please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

sign up for our newsletter illegal and low skilled immigration disproportionally harms the job prospects and wages of black americans peter kirsanow a commissioner on the us civil rights commission told a senate panel wednesday unequivocally the wages and employment levels of black americans are disproportionately adversely affect by illegal immigration particularly when it pertains to the effect on black males kirsanow testified before the senate subcommittee on immigration and the national interest sign up for our newsletter kirsanow also a partner with benesch friedlander coplan  aronoff llp noted that although the commission has been studying the issue of illegal immigration on black americans and has been provided with overwhelming proof of the adverse effects he was not testifying on behalf of the commission the evidence shows that the reason for the adverse impact is actually pretty basic he said black americans especially black males are disproportionally concentrated in the low skilled labor market and are disproportionately more likely to have no more than a high school diploma likewise illegal immigrants disproportionately concentrated in the low skilled labor market and disproportionately more likely to have low levels of academic achievement and these two groups compete with each other in the low skilled labor market he continued the competition is often most fierce in those industries in which blacks have traditionally historically had high concentrations of employment such as hospitality service construction agriculture and blacks very often lose out in this competition to illegal immigrants according to kirsanow the reason black americans and other low skilled american workers lose out is largely due to employers ability to offer lower wages to illegal workers its not because low skilled american workers regardless of race are unwilling to perform such jobs it is that they are unwilling to do such jobs at the cut rate wages and sometime sub standard working conditions tendered to illegal immigrants kirsanow said noting illegal immigrants are unlikely to complaint to government agencies about those poor working conditions the negative affects of these phenomena he said are most prevalent in metropolitan areas and during times like the current economic stagnation since the beginning of the  recession there has been an increase of  million working aged blacks in the population he said however during the same period of time the number of blacks currently in the workforce was also  million less so that there has been no net increase in the number of employed blacks  despite a substantial increase in the black population what is curious about that though is that in the same period of time  million more foreign born worked were employed in the united states kirsanow argued that in addition to the negative economic prospects the displacement causes negative societal problems as well with lower employment rates leading to more imprisonment and reduced family formation comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page
many central american parents who were detained separately from their children during the april to june zero tolerance program are leaving up to  children and youths in the united states according to federal data an additional  migrant children and youths have been reunited with their migrant parents according to the data recently provided to a judge by the department of health and human services but many of their parents may choose to leave some of the  children and youths in the united states when judges eject the parents asylum pleas theres a lot of people from central america who are willing to leave their kids here rather than take them back said mark krikorian the director of the center for immigration studies he continued especially if there is relative here in the united states or if the child is close to  and can get a job and send the money home it makes perfect sense it does not mean in every instance that the illegal migrant knew what they are doing and planned to drop their kids off but it does add some nuance to the sob stories that the media has been retailing the high percentage of children deliberately left by their parents contradicts the medias anguished narrative that the children were cruelly ripped from their uncomprehending parents arms instead the data reinforces the abundant evidence that journalists do not want to recognize how poor central american migrants are rationally exploiting the united states asylum system to win green cards and education for their children many wealthy foreign parents including many chinese and russians use a different strategy to win citizenship for their foreign children they fly into the united states long enough to give birth on american soil and to pick up their childs new social security numbers the number of abandoned central american children will likely rise as us immigration courts order the deportation of the remaining o migrant parents who were released and reunited with their  children since their release the  parents and their  children are allowed to live and work in the united states until a judge decide their pleas for asylum likely in  or  data from prior years suggest that few of the migrants pleas for asylum will be approved by a judge and that most will be ordered home but the available data also suggest that most migrants skip their final hearing to dodge deportation by the department of homeland security most of the kids and parents are probably here to stay and thats what they and the smugglers and the anti border activists are counting on krikorian said how much effort is ice going to put into picking up some  year old whose asylum claim has been turned down trump canceled the zero tolerance enforcement program in june amid an outpouring of emotional complaints from pro migration media personalities pro migration activists and from democratic politicians the enforcement program was portrayed as a cruel family separation program even though the  flores judicial agreement approved by president barack obama requires that children be housed separately when their parents are detained for longer than  days trump announced a new strategy on november  to block the growing number of central american migrants who make asylum requests to help walk past the border guards and into us jobs the new plan will use tent cities to detain migrants and their children until their asylum pleas are resolved in as little as  days the plan also replaces the flores court decision with a new regulation allowing detention of children  with their parents  for more than  days the plan was praised by krikorian they should not be releasing anyone who applies for asylum in the first place  the goal should be that every asylum applicant is held during the entire course of the proceedings he said but added that pro migration groups will likely get friendly judges to block the plan the hhs data sheet shows that  children have been released from the agencys office of refugee resettlement and then reunited with their migrant parents prior to court hearings the hhs data also shows that the group of roughly  abandoned children and youths is comprised of one hundred and eighteen children who have been left in government care by their parents since the parents deportation according to a count by the ameican civil liberties union forty three additional children remain in government care because further review shows they were not separated from parents by dhs thirty three additional children are in government care where a final determination has been made they cannot be reunified because the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child thirty three children are in government care while the parents are outside the united states another  children have parents in the united states but have not been reunited with their parents for reasons that are unexplained by hhs three hundred children have been released from hhs because they have become adults who can file for asylum themselves or because they are being sheltered by other people mostly the relatives of the migrants the released children and youths are free to work in americans workplaces and to use americans schools some of those children and youths may be living close to or with their released parents prior to their asylum hearings if the  are excluded from the overall tally the number of left behind children remains at  overall washingtons economic policy of using migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white collar and blue collar foreign labor that flood of outside labor spikes profits and wall street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue collar and white collar employees the policy also drives up real estate prices widens wealth gaps reduces high tech investment increases state and local tax burdens hurts kids schools and college education pushes americans away from high tech careers and sidelined millions of marginalized americans and their families including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions

rome  pope francis addressed organ donation saturday morning urging catholics to promote this practice as an offering to the lord jesus has identified himself with those who suffer because of illness traffic accidents or work accidents the pope said and therefore it is good for jesus disciples to offer their organs within legal and moral bounds because it is a gift made to the suffering lord who said that everything we do to a brother in need we do to him speaking in the vatican to members of the italian association for the donation of organs tissues and cells aido francis said it is important to promote a culture of donation favoring the offering of a part of the body without disproportionate risks or consequences as a living donation and all the organs after a persons death while praising organ donation as an act of love and altruism the pontiff nonetheless cautioned against the sale of human organs which would produce a commodification of the body or its parts which is contrary to human dignity citing the catechism of the catholic church francis said that organ donation after death is a noble and meritorious act and is to be encouraged as a sic expression of generous solidarity it is not morally acceptable if the donor or his proxy has not given explicit consent the catechism continues moreover it is not morally admissible to bring about the disabling mutilation or death of a human being even in order to delay the death of other persons for those who do not have a religious faith francis said the donation of organs is a gesture towards needy brothers and sisters which should be performed on the basis of an ideal of disinterested human solidarity the generous act of donation serves as a counterweight to contemporary threats against life such as the case of abortion and euthanasia he said and help people understand that life is a something sacred follow thomas d williams on twitter follow tdwilliamsrome please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

a texas district court judge tossed out a defamation lawsuit filed by mohamed mohamed father of the teen better known as clock boy allowing vindicated defendants to seek sanctions against the plaintiff and his attorney in what the american freedom law center aflc described as nearly a three hour hearing held in dallas district court monday judge maricela moore dismissed the claim filed by the plaintiff father on his own behalf and on behalf of his now  year old son ahmed mohamed the teen was the irving high school freshman who on september   brought to class a homemade digital clock in a box that resembled a hoax bomb no charges were ever filed once the situation sorted itself out although initially he was detained by police served three days of suspension and his family withdrew him from school on monday aflc co founder and senior counsel david yerushalmi argued in court on behalf of clients the center for security policy csp and its vice president jim hanson he explained the purpose of a lawfare driven suit is to intimidate into silence those who might comment publicly on the connection between jihad terrorism sharia and islam this case is a classic strategic lawsuit against public participation or slapp case and should be dismissed he stated the judge requested that mohameds counsel fort worth attorney susan hutchison provide any facts that would suggest hanson and the other defendants said anything false or defamatory about mohamed or his son during television broadcasts according to aflc she did not on tuesday breitbart texas obtained a copy of the judges order dismissing the lawsuit against hanson and csp with prejudice after considering the motion all responses and replies thereto and all supporting or opposing affidavits evidence admitted and the arguments of counsel the court finds that the motion is well taken and in all respects granted moore added csp parties were entitled to petition the court for its legal fees and associated court expenses plus recover sanctions against the plaintiff and his attorney and all other further relief to which they may show themselves justly entitled whether at law or in equity by email yerushalmi told breitbart texas aflc also argued in court in part for glenn beck and his production company he said a prior judge now retired previously dismissed the dallas fox affiliate and ben ferguson while i dont represent ben shapiro hell ultimately be dismissed as well because the infirmities of clock boys suit applies to all defendants he said in september clock boys father filed the  page defamation lawsuit against fox television stations llc texas resident ben ferguson ben shapiro city of irving mayor beth van duyne glenn beck and the blaze plus csp and hanson over statements hanson made during an appearance on becks show that the elder mohamed orchestrated an intense media campaign via a local chapter of the council on american islamic relations cair a group the us government formally linked to the muslim brotherhood and to the designated terrorist organization hamas in several formal court filings in federal terrorism cases hanson a counter terrorism expert explained the affair had the look and feel of a typical influence operation to what the muslim brotherhood calls its civilization jihad against the west according to aflc days after the clock boy incident alia salem dallas director of the council on american islamic relations cair spoke to news media asserting ahmed was targeted based on religious and racial identity she hosted a press conference on the mohamed familys front lawn and introduced her group as helping to get ahmeds story out the teen remained in the public eye for months cnn promoted a fundraiser for him time named him one of s top  most influential teens news coverage followed him on his travels from google to qatar he tweeted his every move his father spoke to the press in december aflc attorneys and local counsel pete rowe filed the motion to dismiss on behalf of csp and hanson the motion maintained mohamed and his son became all purpose public figures and remained so following the clock boy incident because ahmed and his family voluntarily pursued publicity then sought to silence others on a matter of public concern at the time yerushalmi stated islamists employ progressive mainstream media to label any public criticism of a sharia centric jihad driven islam as islamophobic and they add fear and financial ruin to the equation by utilizing the legal system to file slapp actions tuesday he told breitbart texas the real danger at work in a case like this is this kind of islamic lawfare literally frightens patriotic citizens into see something say nothing lest you be sued and called a bigot  breitbart

on fridays broadcast of msnbcs live christianity today editor in chief mark galli said he wrote the editorial calling for the removal of president donald trump because he claimed the president had become morally abusive in a dangerous way galli said well what is different about now is the impeachment hearings probably it is true that his record of tweets and his choice of people to work for him has been troubling for some months if not years but up to this point it had been my judgment that dealing with donald trump is like a woman whos married to a man whos verbally abusive but hes a great provider and a good father to his children so she puts up with his loss of temper she weighs that in the balance and says i can still deal with that then the husband turns physically violent and all of a sudden the balancing does not make any sense even though he is still a provider and still a good father he has now become physically dangerous the wisest thing to do is not to balance the books and say the one hand or another but to have him leave the home he added now for donald trump for the longest time i think there was a reasonable case to made to balance the books for evangelical christian im passionately pro life hes done some good things for pro life im passionately for religious freedom hes done good things for religious freedom so a lot of my conservative friends they continue to support him for those reasons saying we dont like his behaviors we dont like his morals but he is doing good things they are doing balancing things it is my judgment in the last couple of weeks that balancing no longer works what we are talking about now is someone who is  one may say to continue the analogy  morally abusive in a dangerous way the scales dont work anymore and it is time for him to leave the house is what my view is follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
joe bidens top political donors gathered for an emergency closed door meeting this weekend in philadelphia pennsylvania as his campaign falls behind rivals in both funds and polling the new york times was first to report the meeting on sunday noting the financiers were treated to a behind the scenes view of the campaigns headquarters and strategy including a private address by the former vice president in a sign of the attendees significant financial firepower mr biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on saturday rallying them for  minutes about the months ahead people there said the times reported the campaign kept the session with mr biden behind closed doors despite pledging to open them to the press the meeting comes as the campaign is besieged by questions over hunter bidens business dealings in ukraine as well as polls showing the former vice president is no longer the frontrunner among  democrats biden who once led the field by as much  percentage points now trails sen elizabeth warren d ma in the early states of iowa and new hampshire adding to the campaigns trouble is the fact that their fundraising numbers were eclipsed this quarter not only by warren but also sen bernie sanders d vt and south bend mayor pete buttigieg  who polled significantly below the former vice president bidens mounting problems and the emergence of warren as the most direct threat was not far from the minds of those gathered in attendance in philadelphia we need him to get the nomination because hes the one who can win denise bauer a biden bundler and former ambassador to belgium told the times to stress the point she added that the former vice presidents donors were going to try to raise every single dollar we can it is unclear if such efforts will be successful enough to save the  year old bidens third white house bid unlike warren or sanders the former vice presidents fundraising has failed to diversify past the top dollar level according to the center for responsive politics more than  donors have already maxed out to bidens campaign since his announcement in late april top dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of bidens campaigns coffers than those of his competitors in comparison only  percent of the campaigns funds to date have come from individuals donating less than  such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after hes secured the nomination david kochel the former chief strategist for jeb bushs failed  presidential bid explained the problem to politico on friday if you dont have that perpetual low dollar fundraising machine you cant compete kochel said biden looks like he cant compete with warren bernie and buttigieg hows he going to compete with trump despite bidens money woes the former vice president is also facing scrutiny over his sons shadowy ties to foreign governments which have taken center stage in the battle to impeach president donald trump the controversy started last month when trump suggested the ukrainian government probe hunter bidens role with burisma holdings the younger biden joined the ukrainian oil and gas giant in  around the same time his father was appointed to oversee obama administration policy in the region as peter schweizer senior contributor at breitbart news detailed in his book secret empires how the american political class hides corruption and enriches family and friends hunter biden secured the position which paid as much as  per month despite having no background in the energy industry or ukraine hunter bidens lack of experience coupled with his fathers influence over ukraine immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the us and europe about a conflict of interest furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that it came during the same month that mykola zlochevsky burismas founder had his assets seized in the united kingdom for suspicion of money laundering some have speculated hunter bidens ascension to burismas board was an attempt by zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings a brazen attempt would not be totally ill suited for zlochevsky the burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern europes top oligarchs a position obtained while serving in the ukrainian government under former president viktor yanukovych  a staunch ally of russian president vladimir putin it was during his tenure in government as ukraines minister of natural resources that burisma received its oil and gas licenses unofficially though it was known that shokin was investigating both burisma and zlochevsky for public corruption it is uncertain if the probe extended to hunter biden although shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter regardless of what occurred shokins successor dropped the investigation into burisma and zlochevsky allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in  biden for his part has refused to discuss the matter even lashing out at the media for asking if his sons work with burisma posed a conflict of interest during his tenure in the vice presidency the tactic however does not seem to be doing biden or his campaign any favors a new poll released on friday indicates that  percent of americans support the department of justice opening an investigation into hunter bidens work abroad some of the donors gathered in philadelphia this weekend though saw the issues surrounding hunter biden and ukraine in a different light sheila nix who once served as chief of staff to dr jill biden told the times the former vice presidents struggles were the result of him having to run two campaigns at once hes running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and i think hes doing a great job nix said its a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

sign up for our newsletter harvard university has vowed that it will protect illegal aliens on campus including who are enrolled as students according to the harvard gazette the effort is in anticipation of president elect donald trumps promise to enforce immigration laws earlier this month harvard president drew gilpin faust wrote a letter to the harvard community sharing her concern at the likely effect of trumps policies on students scholars and staff at harvard especially on students who are undocumented sign up for our newsletter she said that the harvard university police department would not cooperate with federal immigration officials without a warrant and that the university would be making additional legal resources available to illegal aliens affiliated with harvard and faust added that she would support president barack obamas deferred action for childhood arrivals daca  an executive action in  that defied congressional will and made it more difficult for legal immigrants to enter the country faust is entitled to her opinions on public policy but what she is not entitled to to is to defy the taxpayers tear up harvards principles or undermine its honor code harvard receives federal funding in various ways and for various purposes such as through research grants or financial aid for students it also benefits from federal tax policies that make donations to harvard tax deductible there is no reason that such funding should be used to benefit people who are illegally in the country at the expense of citizens legal residents or international students who obey the law conversely if harvard really wanted to protest it could reject the federal dollars needless to say harvard will not be turning away the federal governments largesse but there is a deeper problem with accepting undocumented students harvard is one of the most competitive schools in the world nearly  students apply for fewer than  undergraduate slots every aspect of an applicants background  grades sat scores recommendations financial aid eligibility  must be meticulously documented or the application is likely to be rejected creating a special exemption for illegal aliens actually gives them an unfair advantage in the process one could argue that even the undocumented or the dreamers deserve the opportunity of higher education what they do not deserve is an elite education at one of the nations top universities taking a slot away from thousands of other applicants finally life as an undocumented resident often means resorting to various forms of deception some illegal aliens use false social security numbers for example if a typical harvard student were to do that he or she would be suspended or expelled the harvard honor code declares that falsifying data or any other instance of academic dishonesty violates the standards of our community yet harvard not only looks the other way but now pledges special legal assistance to the undocumented a more appropriate and constructive response would be for harvard to end future admissions and employment for those illegally in the country while working with the new trump administration on ways to help those who are already illegally present to take appropriate steps to rectify their status perhaps after a grace period or after completing their education there is compassion for the undocumented  but what about for the law abiding who deserve a place at harvard silence joel b pollak is senior editor at large at breitbart news and a harvard graduate ab  jd  his new book see no evil  hard truths the left cant handle is available from regnery through amazon follow him on twitter at joelpollak comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

bikers who were caught up in the twin peaks arrests in may  have filed motions to recuse the waco district attorney they say they cannot get a fair trial because there is a conflict of interest and have asked for the appointment of an attorney pro tem lawyers for matthew clendennen and burton george bergman allege that mcclennan county district attorney abelino reyna is pursuing the criminal cases against clendennen and bergman because they are suing him in federal court for civil rights violations they are suing the da in his individual capacity and thus he could be held personally liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars if the civil lawsuits are successful breitbart texas obtained the legal documents requesting that the waco da be removed from prosecuting their criminal cases lawyers for the pair assert that the waco da should be recused because he has a clear personal financial incentive to continue the prosecutions against the two bikers the motions filed in the court argue that it is well established law in texas that although it is normally up to a district attorney to initiate his own recusal a trial court may disqualify a prosecutor when the disqualification is based on a conflict of interest that rises to the level of a due process violation lawyers from the dallas law firm of broden and mickelsen say in their press release mr reyna has painted himself into a corner in which he must take the risk of taking the case to trial based on his own financial interests indeed it appears that mr reyna has been cast in the role of the lone player at the blackjack table at  am in the morning doubling down on every losing hand and the reason he is doubling down is that he has no real choice but to double down unfortunately like the proverbial blackjack player he will keep doubling down until he runs out of chips clendennen and bergman were two bikers who with over  others were arrested when they were caught up in the events on may   that led to mass arrests the shoot out killed nine bikers and wounded  others law enforcement officials and judges have been soundly criticized for their handling of these cases the texas criminal defense lawyers association tcdla has condemned the mass arrests of the bikers with cookie cutter indictments and arrest warrants the setting of outrageous  million bonds and making a waco police department detective a grand jury foreman all of the bikers involved were charged with engaging in organized crime and when they were indicted the grand jury took exactly  minutes to hear evidence and deliberate for each indictment dividing  indictments by the nine hours it took on one day to indict those bikers houston attorney carmen roe a past president of the harris county criminal lawyers association hccla told breitbart texas after the mass grand jury indictments the mcclellan county district attorneys office continues to mock our system of justice by presenting  accusations in nine hours giving the grand jury mere minutes to make a decision that could send anyone of the charged to prison for life organized criminal activity is a charge requiring little more than a conspiracy to engage in criminal conduct most attorneys know that conspiracy is one of the easiest charges to allege and the hardest to defend for any citizen accused breitbart texas reported that one of the two mclennan county criminal district court judges named a waco police detective foreman over a newly selected grand jury as also reported the president of the tcdla at the time sam bassett stated that the appointment was shocking even though within the technical requirements of the law regarding grand jury service the fact that a district judge approved this appointment makes it even more concerning the criminal defense lawyer from austin texas asked imagine a private investigator for one of the defendants attorneys being appointed to the grand jury considering the case the lawyer continues that would not be any more appropriate speaking for the tcdla bassett issued a statement that the organizations concern with the twin peaks biker cases began when a justice of the peace with strong law enforcement ties set identical bonds of  for each person arrested he noted that it took weeks for most of the bonds to be reduced and many lost their jobs while they sat in jail bassett wrote the delays in getting proper bonds set with cut and paste arrest warrants was a breakdown in our system of justice the leader of the nations largest state criminal defense association at the time concluded tcdla believes that you carry out justice even in complex cases if there is a commitment to due process from both sides of the bar and judges it is hoped that a stronger commitment moving forward will be implemented as reported by breitbart texas clendennen filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of waco the mclennan county sheriffs office and individual police officers the suit claims that clendennens fourth and fourteenth amendment rights were violated by wacos alleged policy decision to indict and hold people with fill in the name criminal complaints he also complains about the seizure of property motorcycles guns and other property were all seized from the bikers by police the suit states clendennen is a recreational motorcyclist a baylor university graduate former fireman small business owner and a husband and father he says he is no criminal and while he is part of the scimitars motorcycle club he simply took cover inside the restaurant when the shooting began he had been on the patio eating burton george bergman filed a similar civil rights lawsuit the motions to recuse the waco da were filed in the courts where the criminal cases are pending mr clendennens motion was filed in the th district court and mr bergmans motion was filed in the th district court a motion to disqualify has also been filed by another biker ray nelson lawyers for the other two bikers point out that nelson unlike clendennen and bergman have not actually filed a lawsuit against district attorney reyna in filling the motions to remove the da clint broden who was recently released from a gag order sought by reyna and overturned by the court of appeals announced that in pursuing my clients prosecution it is clear that mr reyna is being influenced by his own personal financial interests and that these interests compromise the performance of his public duty only a true independent prosecutor will be in a position to truly act in the publics interest and to seek justice my clients and the citizens of mclennan county deserve a truly independent prosecutor on this case as reported by breitbart texas police characterized the afternoon gathering at the waco twin peaks restaurant as a meeting of criminal biker gangs with violent intent the bikers call the meeting a legitimate organized gathering of motorcycle riders to discuss political and other issues the groups gathered there the texas confederation of clubs and independents coci hold frequent meetings to discuss biker safety issues proposed legislation and other motorcycle issues those at the twin peaks restaurant that day included bikers from christian clubs and veterans riding clubs as opposed to motorcycle clubs and independents riders not associated with a motorcycle or riding club veterans independents christian bikers and other bikers say they are frequently profiled and even detained to see if they have information about bikers obtained while engaging in a biker ministry as previously reported by breitbart texas bikers in the waco twin peaks cases have been prosecuted using guilt by association arguments as reported by breitbart texas they have been fighting the prosecutions persistent use of terms such as outlaw bikers biker gangs and outlaw biker gangs when referring to motorcycle riders and all of the bikers in waco on may th they have cited legal opinions that prevent such guilt by association arguments by the state the bikers have accused the prosecution of citing its own repeated press conferences in order to allow it to repeatedly refer to these clubs as five outlaw biker gangs to support its motions filed in waco courts the prosecution is also charged with citing the facts the state asserted at its press conferences as facts in support of a gag order and in support of its other communications please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

the woman leading democrats in the house of representatives told delegates at the democratic national convention in philadelphia thursday that electing hillary r clinton the first female president of the united states means achieving the dreams and hopes and aspirations of every woman every daughter every son and every family all across our land for generations to come it is a privilege to stand before you as the leader of the house democrats  a caucus honored to serve with our partner sen harry reid and our friend vice president joe biden said house minority leader nancy pelosi d calif who grew up in baltimore and is the daughter and sister of mayors of that city a caucus honored to serve with one of the greatest presidents in our history president barack obama together we passed the affordable care act which would not have been possible without the courage of the house democrats house democrats are diverse and welcoming she said what a contrast with the narrow and restricted club that met in convention in cleveland last week our convention is different and so is our mission she said we come to public service and to this convention not to trumpet darkness but to light a way forward for our country in keeping with the national security theme of the evening the congresswoman name checked the terrorist army that rose up to fill the vacuum in iraq created when us forces retreated in  here is our commitment to the american people for a stronger america first secure our nation with strong action to keep americans safe fighting terror at home and abroad and eliminating isis we must be strong and smart not reckless and rash she said using the common nickname for the islamic state of iraq and syria not president barack obamas construct isil in which the l stands for the levant which is a word device that suggests the center of the fertile crescent between egypt and persia is one contiguous swath that should be without an israel in the foreign policy community whether someone says isis or isil has come to be a signal of ones support or opposition to obamas policies in that region given the rhetorical flak the democrats were taking for not mentioning terrorism in the early days of the convention it would be unfair to read too much into pelosis choice of isis here at the convention the democrats have a workshop of writers churning out everyones speeches most likely the writer who slipped isis into pelosis speech was not savvy to its message meaning in the heart of her address the former speaker of the house said clinton was going to protect our safety by restricting our gun rights at home safer communities demand courage not cowardice in the face of the nra for the sake of the  americans who are killed by gun violence each day we must break the grip of the gun lobby on congress she said then she signaled to speaker paul d ryan r wis that there is something they agree on if youre on the no fly list then you belong on the no buy list clinton will protect our future by goosing up government give away programs she said  programs such as student aid mandated pay for time off and an expansion of the federal governments running of medical care finally clinton was going to protect our democracy by appointing justices to the supreme court who will overturn the citizens united decision which lifted restrictions on political broadcasts for republicans who dismiss the importance of the supreme court or are willing to wait through four years of clinton so that their boss can have a better shot at the white house pelosi made clear that the supreme court is going to be a place with new clinton appointees pelosi said we know what is on the line in what truly is the most important election of our lifetime for the future of the supreme court for the fate of a planet imperiled by climate change for the sake of immigration reform for the promise of an america that rewards hard work instead of those who exploit americas workers for womens reproductive rights equal rights civil rights then for some reason pelosis writer slipped into her supreme court litany the words to do what is right for our service members veterans and military families who have given so much for our country apparently the scribes were also ordered to shoehorn in references to our men and women in uniform obviously there can be no discussion of the department of veterans affairs and the private war its personnel have waged against veterans so that was out of bounds it would have been equally awkward to discuss how the va with the blessing of the gop controlled congress continues to suspend the gun rights of tens of thousands of veterans who seek counseling and other services from the va thus it was slipped into the supreme court section after reproductive rights which is of course the code word for abortion but there is no translation needed when pelosi exhorted the delegates onward to victory democrats are playing for

the uk is facing a serious threat from far right terrorists the countrys top counterterrorism official has said whilst demanding the children of extremists are removed from their parents assistant commissioner mark rowley argued that exposing children to propaganda or parents with unpopular views in the home was as equally wicked as keeping them in environments where there was sexual abuse i wonder if we need more parity between protecting children from paedophile and terrorist parents he added in a speech to the policy exchange think tank on monday evening he also spoke of the twin threat from islamist and right wing extremism and terrorism and drew a direct equivalence between the hate preacher and convicted islamic state terror recruiter anjem choudary and the controversial activist tommy robinson claiming they both inspired attacks uk counter terrorism policing lead mark rowley calls for a whole society response to extremism and terrorism in his valedictory speech read the policyexchange lecture here  httpstcomzfeytymtp pictwittercommkcgtioq  terrorism police uk terrorismpolice february   while choudary became the de facto spokesperson for islamism in the uk mouthpieces from the far right wing such as tommy robinson also attracted notoriety and attention he said continuing the right wing terrorist threat is more significant and more challenging than perhaps the public debate gives it credit for adding that while islamist and extreme right wing ideologies may appear to be at opposing ends of the argument it is evident that they both have a great deal in common mr rowley was speaking unusually freely with his  year career in policing coming to an end in weeks but official police social media platforms promoted and appeared to back his message he also directly compared the group britain first  which has been roundly condemned by authorities whilst their leaders prosecuted  to the islamic extremist groups cage and muslim engagement and development mend mend however have actually been embraced by some uk police forces were teaching officers about islam and islamophobia just last year and frequently share a platform with labour party politicians and leaders and work with local councils cardiff mend team teaching british transport police wales about islam  islamophobia follow link to get involved httpstcoxvkwcvcg pictwittercomgsixbbyiz  mend community mendcommunity october   sadiq khan meanwhile has appointed an activist who has worked with cage as londons deputy integration mayor and leaders of the group have frequently appeared in public with labour leaders including shadow chancellor john mcdonnell mr rowley slammed cage for characterising counter terror programmes as an attack on islam and despite the groups links to police said of mend leaders of mend have claimed the uk is approaching the conditions that preceded the holocaust seeking to undermine the states considerable efforts to tackle all hate crime and making an absurd comparison with state sponsored genocide please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

one texas lawmakers bill if passed during the  legislative session stands to derail school choice options for failing campuses by taking them down a progressive community schools path and bypassing existing options that include re purposing a campus as a public charter school state senator sylvia garcia d houston pre filed sb  a community schools bill in november with minimal media notice it is a dead ringer for the failed  community schools legislation hb  from austin democratic representative eddie rodriguez his bill sought to transform failing campuses into community schools avoiding closure reconstitution andor reopening as a public charter school at the time alternative weekly the austin chronicle relished in hb s maneuver as smart political jujitsu turning the language of parental trigger bills and voucher advocates on its head during the last legislative session garcia authored the companion senate side community schools bills including one for a community schools grant program under her present bill once a school gets identified as failing for two years it would become a community school circumventing closure reconstitution and charter school repurposing although presented as parent teacher community led partnerships community schools are teachers union backed us department of education used sanctioned institutions in  former us education secretary arne duncan prescribed schools as the centers of the community schools need to be open    hours a day six seven days a week  months out of the year with a whole host of activities particularly in disadvantaged communities he said in  duncan declared certain kids we should have  which raised eyebrows across the nation a  community schools promotional video touted expanded school days for instruction health nutrition physical education and strong family and community engagement that includes access to crucial family support systems such as housing language learning and employment all while closing achievement gaps during and after school on weekends and over the summer with enrichment programs they say community schools serve impoverished populations to interject vital and missing support systems that same year american federation of teachers aft president randi weingarten and save texas schools advisory committee chair allen weeks advocated in austin for reclaiming the promise

activists portray community schools as a way to keep failing public schools from closing their doors and fending off charters because the struggling campus would transition into texas community school with district level support critics demonize charters asserting they undermine traditional public schools by diverting billions of public taxpayer dollars away from their coffers are run by private entities are not held to the same accountability standards and are not unionized interestingly community schools employ the same reform portfolio model strategies as charters are taxpayer funded and seek public private partnerships for resources and funding sb  like hb  does not oppose all charter schools though it offers up specialized industry certified types of charter pilot programs where private partners would pony up a minimum of  million for entities with a successful history of providing education services including industry certifications and job placement services to adults  years of age and older whose educational and training opportunities have been limited by educational disadvantages disabilities homelessness criminal history or similar circumstances presently the federal every student succeeds act essa includes a full service community schools program deetta culbertson texas education agency tea spokeswoman told breitbart texas it is a local level decision if a district decides to pursue the community schools route many of the services mentioned are already underway in some of the districts  such as parenting classes family support and youth development

sign up for our newsletter did fox news expect anything less from donald trump sign up for our newsletter after the network taunted the gop frontrunner for two days leading up to thursdays fox news gop presidential debate trump finally decided to skip the debate on tuesday evening setting off another chaotic media firestorm that will make him the centerpiece of every story from here to the iowa caucuses on monday by pushing trump over the edge in what the network may now clearly view as a miscalculation fox news may have inadvertently done trump a favor while doing itself a huge disservice when trump and fox news began sparring over megyn kellys objectiveness at the beginning of the week fox news boss roger ailes may have figured that the combativeness would create more controversy which would lead to even bigger ratings for thursdays debate since the republican national committee cut ties with national review as a debate partner after national review published its anti trump issue trump felt that fox news should have replaced kelly with a more objective moderator especially after kelly helped national review editor rich lowry gin up the magazines against trump manifesto last week sooner or later donald trump even if hes president is going to have to learn that he doesnt get to pick the journalistswere very surprised hes willing to show that much fear about being questioned by megyn kelly fox news said in a monday statement after trump polled his instagram followers on tuesday about whether he should participate in the fox news debate trump asked megyn kelly is really biased against me she knows that i know that everybody knows that do you really think she could be fair at a debate fox news inexplicably upped the ante by mocking and taunting trump in an unprecedented statement to left leaning mediaite perhaps ailes wanted to get an over the top response from trump so the network could hype the kelly v trump clash like vince mcmahon promotes wrestlemania controversy does indeed create cashand ratings but even veteran cnn journalist john king said he had never seen a media organizationlet alone one that claims to be fair and balancedissue such a statement which inexplicably turned the process for choosing the countrys next president into a joke fox newss taunt was the last straw for trump who decided soon after that he was done playing ailess games after the wise guy press release after reading it trump said i said bye bye after blasting lightweight kelly as a third rate journalist at an iowa event trump said that his decision to skip the fox news debate was pretty close to irrevocable fox is playing games trump said they cant toy with me like they toy with everybody else let them have the debate lets see how they do with the ratings soon after trumps tuesday evening iowa event trump campaign manager corey lewandowski told the washington post that trump is definitely not participating in the fox news debate his word is his bond game over it was the childishly written  taunting pr statement by fox that made me not do the debate more so than lightweight reporter megynkelly  donald j trump realdonaldtrump january   instead trump will hold a town hall event to raise money for wounded warriors while his rivals debate for three tedious hours fox newss advertisers may even want some of their money back ailes may really want to save the country from trump but his taunting press release which was reportedly  his may have unintentionally done trump many favors while backfiring big time on fox news if trump keeps his word and skips the debate first fox newss childish press release from left field proved to trump that the network had no intention of being impartial and it gave him the perfect excuse to skip a debate from which he did not have much to gain frontrunners with huge leads routinely avoid giving their upstart challengers debates because there is not much to gain and everything to lose now trump wont have to go through fox newss anti trump gauntlet while fending off seven challengers bent on dethroning him it also allows trump to separate himself from his crowded field of challengers second unlike other gop candidates trump has never needed fox news because of his unmatched celebrity and near universal name recognition trump has been able to go over the heads of the mainstream media cable and network news networks in an unprecedented way this election cycle getting his messageand criticisms of other candidatesdirectly to voters and as the frontrunner heading into iowa he doesnt need a fox news debate to close the deal with his supporters but fox news needs trump for ratings already ailes has reportedly been desperately trying to reach out to trump who has reportedly told fox news that he will only field calls from rupert murdoch fox news will probably now have to make major concessions to get trump to participate in the debate the one downside of skipping the debate for trump is that he may leave himself open to three hours of attacks without being able to defend himself in real time but trump could easily display his mastery of social media and tweet his counterattacks or better yet trump could go on rival networks the next morning and have comebacks ready for everything that was said about him the night before by saturating the media the morning after the debate when final impressions about what happened the night before are congealed trump could have the last word on every issuecriticismcandidate in the crucial few days before iowans vote since trump will be the story regardless of what happens at the debate nobody after all knows the orchestra pit theory of politics better than ailes and trumps media appearances on friday morning will bigfoot anything that happened the night before thursdays debate will not be as compelling without trump and may resemble a glorified undercard debate it will lack drama and hence ratings john kasich will continue to appeal to liberals jeb bushs new haircut posture and gestures will not convince viewers he has more energy new jersey governor chris christie will try his best to be relevant by attacking the gobbledygook spoken by the senators the moderators will probably ignore dr ben carson again and sens rand paul r ky marco rubio r fl and ted cruz r tx will drone on like senators and viewers will think at times that they are watching c span by skipping the debate trump will only reinforce his strengths among his supporters trump has drawn new voters into the political process and rocketed to the top of nearly every poll because blue collar americans think he will be their jackass who will stick up for the country and their interests against washingtons permanent political class and the global elite that have colluded to screw them over by giving fox news the proverbial middle finger trump reinforces his anti establishmentoutsider bonafides trumps potential absence from the debate though presents some dangers for fox newss brand conservative voters felt that fox news had a finger on the scale for establishment gop candidate mitt romney during the  election cycle and after the network hired cnn retreads and endlessly promoted centrist kelly after the  election many of the networks core viewers unenthusiastically watched fox news because it was the least offensive news outlet on television kellys giggling love fest with michael moore on tuesday evening did the network no favors with heartland viewers that rush limbaugh said do not think fox news is the conservative network that it used to be the networks treatment of trump has indeed only reinforced the suspicions many fox news viewers have had about the networks move toward the center when fox news and kelly tried to take out trumps knees in the first debate by painting him as a sexist with a misleading and loaded question that accused trump of referring to women as pigs dogs disgusting animals and saying that it was a pretty picture to see a celebrity apprentice contestant on her knees the backlash was immediate a fox news source told new york magazine that  in the beginning virtually  percent of the emails were against megyn kelly and ailes was not happy because most of the fox viewers were taking trumps side one can only wonder how fox news viewers will react after the network taunted and mocked the gop presidential frontrunner and compelled him to walk away from the last debate before the iowa caucuses comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit

fitton impeachment coup update the president the rule of law and our constitution continue to be abused as the senate impeachment trial of president trump continues judicial watch is going to court to uncover details of the alleged monitoring of president trumps family lawyer and journalists as ordered by the since recalled us ambassador to the ukraine marie yovanovitch clinton emails recently found by the fbi show the former secretary of state using her unsecure non government email to transmit classified information one of the most important things we can do in this election year is continue to force states and counties across the nation to comply with the national voter registration act of  nvra as the impeachmentcoup against president trump marches on judicial watch is taking the lead on exposing the full truth about the various deep state officials at the center of some of the controversies at issue rep adam schiff d ca in potential violation of law abused his power to secretly subpoena and then publish the private phone records of innocent americans the fraudulent house impeachment effort has matters exactly backward president trump didnt commit high crimes he is a crime victim if anyone should be put on trial in the senate it is rep adam schiff there is no abuse of power by president trump but it is clear that abuses were committed against him by the doj the state department the fisa court and certainly by democrats in the house we just sued the state department for documents related to a reported untouchables list given by former us ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch to ukraine prosecutor general yuriy lutsenko in late  the state department just confessed to a court that fbi found more clinton emails that were then turned over to state for review the corrupted case for impeachment suffered major setbacks this week there was no direct or indirect evidence of any misconduct by president trump we have conducted an in depth analysis of obama era white house visitor logs and we have learned a good deal about the people who controversial cia employee eric ciaramella met with while assigned to the white house the house of representatives impeachment resolution vote this week endorses an abusive process that rolls over the rights of president trump and undermines the rule of law this was no impeachment resolution  it was a coup resolution the associated press founded in  as a cooperative association of newspapers has enjoyed a reputation for independence and fairness over the years lately however it has come under criticism for what some see as a leftliberal bias was president obamas ambassador to ukraine unlawfully tracking articles reports and social media postings of conservatives our corruption chronicles blog has the story what does cfius know about hunter bidens questionable overseas ventures the agency is playing its cards close to the vest so we are suing the state and treasury departments for information rod rosenstein formerly the deputy attorney general is a key figure in enabling at a minimum the deep states seditious attacks on president trump joe biden deserves a trophy for his audacity but hes not going to escape serious scrutiny over his apparent threatening of the ukraine government for his sons personal gain judicial watch has made public  pages of heavily redacted djj documents showing obama state department officials efforts to disseminate classified information prior to trumps inauguration our powerful and secretive spy agencies were unleashed and the justice department and the fbi are making it difficult for us and even congress to get to the bottom of it judicial watch just released the transcript of a major court hearing held last week in which us district court judge royce c lamberth granted significant new discovery to us on the clinton email issue judicial watch v us department of state the court rejected justice and state department arguments to protect mrs clinton and the agencies from additional discovery and ordered agency lawyers to respond to our questions about their knowledge of the clinton email issue if you can get the department of justice to attack the person who beat you in a presidential race you are fairly clever or maybe not  as nefarious characters in the doj were more than willing to help hillary clinton as the justice department reportedly takes a step to give james comey a pass for illegal activity judicial watch is uncovering the details of these crimes rep ilhan omar is in the news often because of her racially inflammatory anti semitic views but our concern at this moment is her alleged criminal behavior judicial watch has obtained new emails showing that senior obama state department officials advanced the russiagate hoax just before the  presidential election next time youre waiting in your socks as your luggage is rifled through by security at the tsa checkpoint you might reflect on how unchecked people and vehicles are getting through security in other parts of the airport our corruption chronicles blog exposes the disturbing facts mr hackett testified under oath that he had raised concerns about former secretary of state hillary clintons missing email john kerry president obamas secretary of state seems to be having trouble staying within the legal bounds of the logan act so its not surprising that his state department lieutenants were getting their hands dirty in the conspiracy to bring down donald trump given the fbis repeated intransigence over the years in responding to our foia requests im not of a mind to assume this story represents simply an innocent mistake

billionaire soros the group complains that american elections are dominated by billionaires and big money interests who can spend unlimited sums of money on political campaigns to protect their special interests at the general expense but if the status quo goes unchallenged the  election  already set to be the most billionaire dominated secret money drenched voter suppression marred contest

tuesday on fox news channels tucker carlson tonight network senior political contributor brit hume reacted to carlsons earlier report that an investigation by special counsel robert mueller has not solely focused on potential collusion between russia and trumps  presidential campaign now reportedly it includes elements of hillary clintons campaign donald trumps opponent in that election hume said that the tide may now be turning on the probe which is that it may now implicate some long time washington dc democrats transcript as follows carlson brit hume is a fox news senior political analyst and he joins us tonight brit the fact or the idea from our source that paul manafort was working for the podesta group on behalf of russian interests before running the trump campaign changes this story completely it seems to me brit hume fox news senior political analyst it does to change completely tucker it suggests that what collusion there have been between paul manafort and the podesta group on behalf of russian interests and the podesta group  these two guys tony and john they lie at the heart of the democratic party and certainly of the clintons and their political endeavors so this changes the whole character and focus and it does raise also the question tucker when youre coming around to getting at this now and thats remarkable on your part to have gotten this source to come and talk to you how could it be that all these journalists working for other news organizations have been chasing this story these many months and never run across any of this remarkable indeed carlson well thats exactly the point hume it does change things carlson well how could actually i mean youve been in journalism longer than ive been alive how could the central front group that manafort was representing the money goes through the podesta group and nobody notices i mean the podesta group has  employees in washington nobody has mentioned that to a journalist in the past  months i find that not believable hume well its pretty striking and it suggests that the work has been done and this story has not been of the best quality or this would have turned up and i would also suggest that you have a pack of journalists who are so determined to follow one story line that they completely missed this but this is a big deal on a lot of levels and it is particularly noteworthy that we hear that robert mueller is on this and suggested that his investigation which might have been initially about russian efforts to influence the election is now much more broad gazed effort to determine the extent and depth of russian efforts to influence american policy going back several years and if thats the case and if all we hear about the podestas is true it seems to me that the democrats have been complaining about this and making all kinds of allegations about this all this time are going to be very disappointed in its outcome carlson well yes i mean considering that for the last year weve heard that america faces no greater foe has never faced a greater foe than putins russia and theyre seeking to undermine our democracy destroy our country and now it turns out the two of the people closest to hillary clinton were working for them hume yes carlson i mean i dont really know how democrats will respond to that hume well it is also the case too of course if we look at this uranium one matter that is coming more and more to light it appears that we have the obama administration in its effort to seek a closer relationship with russia acquiescing a sale of materials that are strategic and that could certainly be argued place american security interests at some risk and you know all of this going on of course while and this has been known  unlike what youve just reported this has been known for some time but it seems to be coming into sharper focus at the moment and will be the subject of the congressional investigations going forward so democrats can scream a lot and they no doubt will that all of that is a diversion but im beginning to think that those claims and accusations are going to ring a little hollow in light of what your reporting and in light of what else is coming out even as we speak tonight carlson we cant get a democrat on the show tonight we can get a member of congress of course we reach out immediately to the podesta group for comment on what we found we didnt hear back from them as if there isnt enough news today theres late breaking news that apparently the information that comprise the now famous dossier that buzzfeed printed that information was paid for by the dnc and the hillary clinton presidential campaign im not even sure how to respond to this hume right you know well it is striking because you know that dossier even as it appeared at the time was pretty widely recognized even among media unsympathetic to donald trump as curlers and a lot of it was demonstrably false so this was a pretty shabby piece of business here and if it turns out that as we now believe that it was paid for in considerable measure by the clinton campaign and the democratic party and of course this contained within it tucker were allegations about trump collusion with the russians so that tends to soil that whole allegation even further so the tide may be now turning in all this in political terms and one might also open journalistic terms carlson kind of brazen though i mean if one of your chief fundraisers and the guy whos running your campaign is in effect working with paul manafort its a little brazen for you to run around claiming that paul manafort when he worked for donald trump was colluding with the russians no i mean what does it take to claim something like that hume well brazen might be the right word you know one hardly knows what to say about that but it certainly reveals another side of the story that may be bigger and more important than these allegations which have so far remained virtually without evidence carlson yes hume the allegations of collusion between the trump campaign itself and the president the man who is now president and the russians is virtually nonexistent after all these months carlson yes hume and now we hear about all this other stuff so as i suggest tucker the tide may now be turning on all of this and not in a way the democrats are going to enjoy carlson no i would be concerned if i were the podestas very concern brit thank you very much for that appreciate it hume you bet tucker follow jeff poor on twitter jeffpoor please let us know if you

sign up for our newsletter sen marco rubio sen ted cruz and gov john kasich all suggested friday night that donald trump was partly responsible for the left wing mob shutdown of his own rally in chicago i wouldnt say mr trump is responsible for the events of tonight but he most certainly in other events  bears some responsibility for the general tone of the things that have been happening before said rubio as he tried to blame trump for prior protests  and clashes  at his rallies sign up for our newsletter i think its the job of leaders not to stoke that anger but to use that anger and channel it in a way that allows us to reach solutions as opposed to stoke that anger in a way that drives us to a political victory on a given election year rubio told cnn shortly after he declared he was very sad for our country cruz packaged his criticism of trump in the same more in sorrow than anger tone this is a sad day political discourse should occur in this country without a threat of violence without anger and rage and hatred directed at each other he said in rolling meadows illinois just north of downtown chicago he continued earlier today over  people were arrested in one rally and then tonight as violence broke out the rally was cancelled altogether now the responsibility for that lies with protestors who took violence into their own hands but in any campaign responsibility starts at the top any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign and when you have a campaign that disrespects the voters when you have a campaign that affirmatively encourages violence when you have a campaign that is facing allegations of physical violence against members of the press you create an environment that only encourages this sort of nasty discourse the prior rally where people were arrested was a trump rally in st louis missouri ohio gov john kasich released a similar statement tonight the seeds of division that donald trump has been sowing this whole campaign finally bore fruit and it was ugly some let their opposition to his views slip beyond protest into violence but we can never let that happen i urge people to resist that temptation and rise to a higher level now is the time for americans to come together and stand firm for what we know is true we are great because we are a peaceful people who live by the rule of law we are stronger together we will reject those who try to divide us for personal gain and we will do it the right wayat the ballot box trump ignored the criticism from his rivals and pointed towards the mob of diverse radicals who waved mexican and communist flags carried pro amnesty slogans wore islamic headgear and stomped on american flags its a little bit sad when you cant have a rally in a major city in this country  what ever happened to freedom of speech what ever happened to the right to get together trump told msnbc our nation is totally divided trump told fox we have so many different sets of divisions and hopefully well be able to bring it together im a unifier president obama has not been a unifier hes been a divider im a unifier ill bring people together comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page
absolutely everything under the sun that could go wrong with this years state of texas assessments of academic readiness staar did failures ranged from online testing glitches and vanishing answers to missing test score results it added to the growing frustration many feel about standardized testing in texas public education education commissioner mike morath responded to the problems plaguing this years exams by scrapping the reading and math testing requirements for fifth and eighth grade students  some who might have otherwise gone to summer school or had to retest later in june because they failed the   staar during the school year i apologize for the continuing problems our students and staff are being forced to deal with because of ongoing reporting issues with our testing vendor morath said in a statement on june  he explained in greater detail monday his decision was largely based on the fact that too many staar scores from a may retest had yet to return from the states new vendor educational testing service ets this has caused many districts and parents a large amount of confusion as the districts dont precisely know which students would be statutorily required to enroll in these summer learning programs and parents havent had results for their kids he wrote the commissioner added that as the texas education agency tea closely monitored the situation it became apparent the results were not in by thursday june  therefore we had to take action to provide clarity to districts and parents for the affected students given the delays from ets we issued guidance encouraging districts to make accelerated instruction decisions entirely on their own rather than wait and attempt to guess at staar results that hadnt yet been received effectively this meant exempting districts and their students from using staar results for this process morath wrote the staar itself has come under fire since it was implemented four years ago to replace the texas assessment of knowledge and skills taks as the end of year yardstick of learning results have remained flat more texas public schools were identified as low performing schools because of poor test scores or unacceptable ratings on the   public education grant peg list this year  campuses landed on that list up from  failing in   the peg list includes more than  school districts and charters translating into over  campuses parents continue to express dissatisfaction with the pivotal role standardized testing plays in public education some boycotting the test by opting out their children from taking the state mandated annual staar in may four parents from around the state sued morath alleging the tea did not follow a law hb  that shortens staar testing time for grades  through  to ensure  of students in grades  can complete exams in two hours and  of students in grades   can do so in three hours they have raised more than  of their  goal to cover attorney fees on their gofundme page to stop the  staar results teachers too feel the pinch of the new accountability system the texas teachers evaluation and support system t tess it was part of the no child left behind nclb waiver requirement from the us department of education t tess requires school districts base  percent of a teachers evaluation on student growth measures such as standardized test scores something which the texas state teachers association tsta believes violates state law tsta the states affiliate to the nations largest teachers union the national education association nea seeks to stop t tess they filed a lawsuit against morath who approved t tess to become the state recommended teacher appraisal system on july  the metric was actually unveiled in  and piloted under former education commissioner michael williams texas dumped its longstanding standardized testing vendor pearson for ets the ride has been bumpy beginning with a sizeable computer glitch in march that erased more than  staar test answers in school districts undergoing testing around the state to as recently as last thursday when the eanes independent school district claimed ets misplaced six grade levels of completed staar tests said morath educational testing service is not new to administering assessments on a large scale basis so i cannot accept the transition to a new testing vendor as an excuse for what occurred for  years the new jersey based company administered californias annual assessment the standardized testing and reporting star program in  the golden state replaced the star with the common core affiliated smarter balanced test as part of the california assessment of student performance and progress caaspp system staar tests matter to students because if they do not pass the reading and math assessments after three attempts they are retained unless a grade placement committee comprised of a principal teacher and the students parents all agree to promote the child to the next grade level high school seniors must pass three out of the five administered end of year staar exams to graduate from october  to march  a  member commission headed up by state board of education sboe chair donna bahorich traveled the state and met with more than  citizens over nine community conversations they sought input and feedback on the staar and other measures to which students and public school districts are held accountable the commission created under a law passed in may was tasked with making recommendations based on their findings to state lawmakers by september  that could even include proposing the state replace the staar with a new test our constituents often talk to board members about testing and school ratings issues said bahorich in a statement tuesday june  i felt it was also important for board members to have in depth discussions to learn what educators parents business people and others want from these two high profile programs i believe our findings will be useful in shaping the next generation systems bahorich seeks even more public input an online survey is open to all texans through june  follow merrill hope a member of the original breitbart texas team on

sign up for our newsletter whenever the media loses control over a powerful term be it fake news or deep state they react with infantile rage and immediately demand cessation of the term in its unapproved use as part of that process they attempt to restrict its historical application to some definition that delimits its use against their ideological interest their attempt to rescript the meaning of words gives new meaning to orwellian for the medias would be ministry of information maybe cnn will set up a lexicon where we can go and see which words we are allowed to use to ascribe their own activities much as chris cuomo insinuated it was illegal for anyone to look at wikileaks information except exclusively at cnn what this all really covers up in this context is that the media has long been an enabler of the deep state against the democratic demands of the public no cnn the idea of the deep state didnt start in turkey and no new york times pretending the deep state doesnt exist doesnt clothe the naked emperor the legal and historic idea of the deep state originated in america in a trilogy of studies by a trio of political scholars the originalist behind the idea was german emigre ernst fraenkel who identified nazi germanys path to dictatorship as rooted in the dual state where an anti democratic prerogative state often controls much of a governments policy without regard to or respect of legal and democratic constraints the idea gained currency in the scholastic community with a famous  study of our state department by hans morgenthau which concluded the american government increasingly and precariously employed a dual state defined as a democratic state and a security state whose hidden security hierarchy monitors and controls the democratic part of the state for the institutional and ideological interests of this parallel security state both eisenhower and kennedy followed up on the concept in eisenhowers respective farewell address famously warning about the military industrial complex of our own government and kennedys parallel speech to the american newspaper publishers association ten days after the failed bay of pigs in ascribing the method of communist governments the idea expanded into the deep state in the broader journalistic community when professor peter dale scott in  coined the term deep politics to explain aspects of american politics since the s an american journalist then applied it to explain certain issues that arose in turkey in  but its ideological bonafides has been long applied to american politics and politics more generally around the globe a long time dc staffer applied it to our government again in a popular political text the deep state for how the machinery of the bureaucracy is increasingly immune from the votes of the public in ascribing and prescribing the governments actual policy toward its own citizenry and those abroad the latter took root in certain conservative populist communities with some overlap from nader ite leftists though the en bubbled media missed it all apparently instead cnn the new york times and the economist would have us believe the deep state only refers to some odd foreign country like turkey and can never be honestly applied here this is especially ironic for the economist because it was one of their original editors in chief walter bagehot from the s who first circulated the idea of a double government as leftist reporter glenn greenwald has reported and liberal newscaster ed schultz continues to emphasize the establishment medias over use of anonymous sourcing allows deep state members to smear a disfavored political persona like trump or michael flynn under constant assault in media reports long after he left the white house and others as both journalists warn when the media reflexively reveres serves believes and sides with hidden intelligence officials it dis serves its first amendment role as a check on power and instead becomes an enabler of that anti democratic power the rise of wikileaks and its increasing popularity across the left and right ends of the populist political spectrum reflects an increasingly common view that the media is the corrupted power brokers not a check on those corrupted power brokers as greenwald aptly summarizes cheering for the cia and its shadowy allies to unilaterally subvert the us election and impose its own policy dictates on the elected president is both warped and self destructive trumps tweets last week directed attention to precisely that issue illegal intercepts and illicit leaks of those intercepts should be the scandal not incredulous reports of collusion unsupported by the legally innocent conversations found on those intercepts obama went into bed with the deep state after promising to protect the public from unlawful spying one of his first acts was to immunize those members of the deep state who did so illicitly after promising transparency one of obamas first acts was for his nsa director clapper to perjure himself to congress about nsa spying on americans after which obama promoted clapper to head of the office of national intelligence a two step act that gave us edward snowden after promising public disclosure obama prosecuted more whistleblowers than all  of his presidential predecessors combined after promising public access obama delayed and obstructed more foia requests than anyone and his secretary of states infamously hid emails in a private email server that could have masked her clinton cash activities from public view is it any surprise then that obama could possibly use the deep state to undermine the election spy on his political adversaries as he did to cbs reporter sharyl attkison where she found government ip based hackers turning her computer on and off during the night along with the obama administration spying on fox reporter james rosen and ap reporters and likely eavesdrop on trump based on the many new york times reports referencing intercepted calls of trump campaign members what is unique is obama trying to use the deep state in collusion with the media to create a de facto shadow government aside from its anti democratic instincts the other great threat from the deep state is its incestuous insularity the deep state advised coups overthrows and assassinations against democratic governments like guatemala in  and congo in  that birthed civil wars and gangs that hollowed out democratic hopes in those countries for decades and haunt us to this day the deep states poor advice misread the popularity of the shah in iran giving us the  revolution which led into the nuclear would be threat they are today cite the misguided idea of arming the taliban in afghanistan birthing much of modern day radical islamic terror as a political movement and the mirrored debacles in failed nation states and now terror riddled iraq and libya the failure of the media to expose the deep states miscalculations and their misdeeds remains one of the great media failures of the last decade why did the media say there were wmds in iraq because the deep state told them so why does the media say there cannot be tapped calls on trump two days before wikileaks discloses massive cia spying capabilities through smart phones and even tvs because they refuse to expose the deep state instead they pen pieces saying the deep state doesnt exist or only exists even as an historic idea in turkey what a bunch of turkey that is in this respect a trip down memory lane is productive contrary to conventional wisdom americas most famed whistleblower deep throat was anything but innocent in his intentions the operative who went by the alias of deep throat was integral to the corrupted parts of the fbi under hoover and reacted with rage when nixon tried to de hooverize the fbi nixon made enough mistakes to last a lifetime and his resignation was well warranted but that cannot mask the criminality and anti democratic purposes of his primary antagonist mark felt aka deep throat was actually one of the principal culprits behind cointelpro a deep state operation within the fbi that misused and abused government power to spy on and sabotage domestic political movements in the united states felt had agents break into peoples homes conduct black bag jobs against innocent american citizens and engaged in campaigns to discredit and disrupt various anti war civil rights and other deep state disfavored political groups felt was later indicted and convicted which enraged felt who felt he was beyond the reach of the law stating all that mattered is that he felt what he did was in the best interests of the country and could not be indicted on technical reasons those technical reasons being a conspiracy to violate americans most protected constitutional rights felt personified the deep state and the man that made him a hero is our most celebrated journalist alive bob woodward what does the deep state campaign against trump look like just like cointelpro from the illegal surveillance to the unlawful disinformation campaigns thats not a coincidence any more than trump hinting at the scope of this problem in his tweets and his historical analogizing it to the fascists coup of power in europe in the s his real meaning of tying in obama was to clue in observers that obama had got into bed with the deep state and wiretapping your opponents is one of the great harms such ugly marriages bring its a marriage  between the media and the deep state  that

willie brown the first african american mayor of san francisco has used his latest san francisco chronicle column to condemn liberal intolerance at the university of california berkeley towards conservative speakers as the reversal of that campuss free speech legacy the context for browns criticism is the decision by uc berkeley not to allow conservative author ann coulter to speak on campus that decision was reversed but the university insisted that coulter speak at a designated date and time when classes were not in session or when few students were likely to attend in order to minimize the risk of violent protests in  berkeley was the birthplace of the free speech movement which demanded the right to advocate for any political cause on campus with or without the approval of the administration the movement broke open dialogue on campuses nationwide and inspired a generation of activists to join protests against the vietnam war and other causes brown notes an odd irony  present at many other campuses today as well  where the students are demanding an end to free expression the very right that their parents generation marched to protect and expand he writes when the free speech movement got rolling at uc berkeley in the s the whole point was winning the right to speak out about civil rights sex the vietnam war or anything else on your mind it was youth versus the man now its youth demanding the shutdown and the man expressing outrage at the death of free speech and the cops being sent in to protect it hows that for a reversal read browns full column berkeley betrays its free speech legacy here joel b pollak is senior editor at large at breitbart news he was named one of the most influential people in news media in  he is the co author of how trump won the inside story of a revolution is available from regnery follow him on twitter at joelpollak please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

brexit leader nigel farage has attacked the labour party for moving towards supporting the continued free movement of people after britain leaves the european union eu labours shadow brexit secretary sir keir starmer and andy mcdonald the shadow transport secretary have both hinted that opinion in the parliamentary party on the issue is shifting after they previously promised to support ending free movement in their election manifesto questioned on the bbcs andrew marr show over the weekend if labour would embrace open borders along with other eu rules to retain access to the blocs markets after brexit sir keir replied we are facing up to that we would have to negotiate on the four freedoms it is very likely that we are going to need an immigration policy that does allow people to cross borders across the uk across the eu to work mr mcdonald added i think weve got to have an agreement with the european union that gives us the ability to see people come into the country in sectors where we need them sir keirs words were immediately welcomed by the radical alt left group hope not hate which supports open borders and has taken funding from the leftist billionaire george soros through his open society foundations labours keirstarmer just told andrew marr we must have a single market deal hes right a hard brexit would be devastating for already struggling communities giving the far right fertile ground to exploit have a read of this from lowlesnick httpstcogwzt  hope not hate hopenothate june   mr farage a member of the european parliament hit back on twitter writing the british people voted for border controls not more unskilled mass migration after brexit earlier this month sir keir said free movement would have to be negotiated with the eu and he announced labour would call on the government to strike a new single market deal with the bloc eu leaders have been categorical that full access to their single market must involve continued free movement and open borders obviously we will have to set out what it is that we seek to achieve sir keir said the eu is obviously looking at free movement itself and it will be part the negotiation adding full access to the internal market means the benefits of the internal market which has always been the labour party position obviously that comes with obligations and thats why weve said it has to be underpinned by shared institutions and shared regulations remain campaigners warned wages would go up if britain voted for brexit thankfully they were right  httpstcodqeakuqfp  breitbart london breitbartlondon november   please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
this morning britains high court ruled that the government must consult the british parliament before invoking article  of the lisbon treaty beginning britains exit from the european union the ruling is wrapped in irony the irony of a high court still subservient to brussels demanding than an un sovereign parliament which brexiteers wish to be sovereign vote on whether that court remains subservient or not while we leave campaigners fear the actions of the parliament we want to be sovereign now the establishment is narrowing the path to brexit with the early  timetable hanging in the balance i believe we may be on the cusp of something we havent seen in our country in many decades en masse direct action we know the anti establishment side can do it remember the iraq war protests or the march against the fox hunting ban why the government promised to implement the will of the people and the very definition of a referendum is that it is a vote by the general public which has been referred to them for a direct decision who s up for projecting this onto the high court tonight pictwittercomafkagxn  raheem kassam raheemkassam november   taken together this would in the minds of most sane people be regarded as direct democratic action which therefore supersedes parliament for what is parliament if not the representatives of the people and if the people have been consulted directly then why should parliament opine why should parliamentarians be they commoners or lords be handed ex post facto a greater say in a direct referendum than the average voter this is why todays ruling by lord chief justice lord thomas sir terence etherton and lord justice sales is simply judicial activism of the worst kind who it is clear from todays pictures that one of the men behind this court action is charlie mullins the owner of pimlico plumbers and all round flash git he was brought into the leave campaign fold by matthew elliott and vote leave under false pretences  as reported by breitbart london  and now may be exacting his revenge by supporting this court action but the claimant herself is a woman called gina miller the founder of what looks like a chop shop investment firm in marylebone whose endorsers including august individuals such as mr d from slough and remainiac journalist tim walker curiously ms millers firm scm private reported a half a million pound loss last year up from a quarter of a million pound loss the year before perhaps just perhaps we shouldnt be listening to people who lose money hand over fist for what is best for the british economy now what the government has promised to challenge the ruling in the unsupreme court more of that irony but at this point who trusts the government or its lawyers to perform the basic task of informing the court that the referendum itself was supreme supreme over the government over parliament and indeed over the judiciary if the judiciary cannot or refuses to see that then the british public may well revoke its consent to be governed by parliament and have its laws interpreted by the judiciary and that starts with taking to the streets and demonstrating our frustrations if that doesnt work then just a few million quid would be enough to campaign against and effectively remove many remain mps in parliament if ukip isnt up to the challenge  which i suspect it may not be  then it will be up to us the people to crowdfund this cash and get it done ourselves taking on the money of people like charlie mullins the activism of the judiciary and the ineptitude of the government wont be easy but if we do not show our teeth now we will forever be taken for granted and oppressed get ready for the fight raheem kassam is the editor in chief of breitbart london please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

father neville fernando tor froze he was standing in the middle of st sebastians church in negombo sri lanka on easter sunday in the immediate aftermath of a jihadist attack that would kill over  people and injure  others in three churches and three hotels in the colombo area i heard the explosions i saw the bodies you know  the parts of the bodies legs and hands and all i was just trapped in the middle of the church i could not do anything fernando told breitbart news in an interview on tuesday fernando is in the united states for a series of events to bring awareness to the pain of the persecuted christian church hosted by aid to the church in need on saturday aid to the church in need will host a night of witness event to pray reflect and listen to the victims of christian persecution at the basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate conception in washington dc fernando is here to share his experience rebuilding a community blown apart by suicide bombs and the sudden realization that islamic state radicalization had come knocking on the doors of sri lankas muslim community sri lanka is a majority buddhist nation with significant muslim christian and hindu minorities  most of whom fernando noted had accepted the reality of centuries of christians present in their country he said the government currently in transition after the election of president gotabaya rajapaksa last weekend has not offered a clear explanation for who exactly committed the bombings the islamic state took credit through the sri lankan jihadist group national thowheed jamaath and after heated accusations flew in the highest levels of government then president maithripala sirisena fired his defense secretary and chief of police for disregarding an intelligence report from india that warned of an impending attack the move did little to resolve who planned this attack however or prepare for future attempts our people are asking for justice  which cannot be swept under the carpet fernando said we are all in a dilemma  no one can justify violence in the name of god we all know that god is love merciful love in its most radical expression the bombings targeted hotels because many christians tend to go to their restaurants for a celebratory easter brunch in the churches eyewitnesses said they say the suicide bombers detonated towards the back of the church to have a better chance of killing children as parents of babies tend to stand in the back in case their child cries and they need to make a quick exit the churches were so crowded that the bombs destroyed many bodies leaving so many limbs in the wreckage that police initially overestimated the dead by nearly  before dna tests confirmed many of the remains belonged to the same individuals i was just unconscious at that time i was telling all others what had happened to me i did not know  for five minutes i was fainted  but after that i just came out of the church he told breitbart news i called police emergency services and i was calling all my friends to say what happened  we still didnt know what it was it was a very bad attack after finding the living among the rubble fernando said he and other clergy began carrying the sick and wounded visiting all the hospitals and taking care of them and finally for a while we were very busy at that time administering last rites and consoling survivors it was a very very big tragedy we were listening and consoling them whatever we could do at that time  we were with them we were praying he recalled today much of the work needed in his congregation is emotional and spiritual we pray the rosary together with them and we organize healing services  our prayers for the suffering and pain counseling for those that are traumatized more spiritual support to help carry on with their lives he told breitbart news fernando said he and the catholic leadership in the country have endeavored to prevent revenge attacks by insisting that christianity is not a faith of vindictiveness he noted that many among the buddhist majority came they were consoling us telling us not to be afraid that we are with you  part of the emotional recovery he told breitbart news was the shock of the attack in light of relative peace in the aftermath of the sri lankan civil war between buddhists and muslims that lasted  years and ended in  the president elects brother mahinda rajapaksa is often credited with ending that war and returned to power on thursday as prime minister in part due to frustrations with the previous governments response to the easter attacks we didnt have anything against the muslim community in sri lanka catholics and muslims  we were working together so that is a problem still we are searching for that why did it happen to us fernando said his concern for knowing who organized the attacks and insisting that local muslims who knew the christian community in negombo largely had no problems with them echoes similar confusion and disappointment elsewhere in south asia particularly in light of the fall of the islamic state in iraq and syria the collapse of the caliphate headquartered in syria triggered a flood of battle hardened jihadis into countries like sri lanka the philippines afghanistan pakistan india and much of africa some of it is the reversal of a wave of southeast asian citizens who joined the caliphate between   but many are foreigners fleeing the consequences of their terrorist activities in the middle east this complicates a scenario in which the small but extremely religiously diverse nation was already struggling against people who dont like to see our way of living fernando said the problem is not the government leaders but the people who are very much going against us because of our way of living  they have leaders but they are not obeying even the muslims he said politicians capitalizing on those tensions have not helped he added there is a time during the period of elections where lots of damage is done even to the muslims and buddhists  politicians are always going after the vote he told breitbart news they neglect the uniformity or the unity of the country and the reconciliation of the country and the duty of the country our motto is that we should be all we need all of humanity  we are sri lankans he insisted that is what we need today in sri lanka  to learn to appreciate the differences and to accept each other and show mercifulness to each other follow frances martel on facebook and twitter please let us know if you re having issues with

president barack obama included an unusual phrase about presidents in his most recent campaign speech for hillary clinton just hours after the fbi revealed that it was revisiting the investigation surrounding hillary clintons private email server obama praised clinton for understanding how to lead the country despite political differences during a speech in orlando florida obama said she understands nobody is perfect  not even presidents the president has largely remained quiet about the investigation as he prepares to host six more political rallies for clinton this week but he told the audience that all political figures should act on basic homespun values like honesty decency and generosity thats what we should expect he said obama reminded supporters that he had made his own mistakes during his time as president i will tell you this ive made mistakes during these eight years and there have been times where weve had ups and theres been times where weve had lows he said but i kept that promise to work for you as hard as i could obama urged supporters to organize the vote despite polls that were showing clinton ahead he also warned about the noise in the election that made it difficult for voters to get the truth the media stories go up and down and theres a lot of noise he said and sometimes its hard for folks to sort out whats right and whats wrong whats true whats false which is why the other guy can just say whatever he wants right he specifically blamed the internet for making it harder for people to know about the truth about the election these days because of the nature of the internet and social media sometimes its hard to sort out whats true and whats false he said obama admitted that in  he understood why some people had become cynical during the election and wanted to ignore politics i know theres a lot of crazy stuff on tv and the even crazier stuff on the internet he said but you have the chance right now to reject a divisive mean spirited politics that would take us backwards comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

migrant communities in germany especially those in poverty are becoming more insular and rejecting western society and values in larger numbers according to a new study the biggest challenge of the migrant crisis has been the ability of the german government to properly integrate migrants from the middle east north africa and elsewhere into german society a new study by the german association for housing and urban development vhw shows that migrants especially those of a lower income bracket are becoming less integrated and some outright reject the culture of germany entirely reports die welt the study named immigrant worlds in germany  looks at migrants within the major cities and municipalities of the country shows that many migrant groups are choosing to isolate themselves rather than establish links with those of other backgrounds bernd hallenberg who works for the vhw said the migrant milieus are developing apart noting that many migrant communities retreat into themselves on a social and cultural level the study shows a trend of migrants who once saw themselves as germans identifying more with the ethnic and cultural background of their origin a similar study was carried out in  by the vhw that when compared to the current study shows a large shift toward isolation rather than integration one person who was questioned as a part of the study even said we are not germans we are now turks and added my friends are mostly religious and mostly foreigners not just turks i believe we have more common things with them than with germans the study questioned  people who had come to germany by the end of  a further  who had come to german from the period of  to  and  asylum seekers who had come to germany over the course of the migrant crisis since  germany is set to spend billions on the integration of new migrants per year but if the vhw study is any indication the money may be largely wasted some academics have urged the german government to take a radically different approach and encourage the further ghettoization of migrant groups sociologist annette treibel believes that it is germans who should integrate into migrant cultures to make the newcomers feel more welcome similar proposals have been made by other academics who see the idea of an overarching german culture as proto fascist notion they have called for mandatory arabic lessons for germans in the public education system an even more radical proposal was made by salafist expert and green party member kurt edler who said that syrian asylum seekers shouldnt be expected to integrate into german society and should instead be given their own city which he called a new aleppo please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

on sundays broadcast of cbss face the nation former obama national security adviser susan rice said the death abu bakr al baghdadi the leader of isis was not mission accomplished rice was apparently referencing the controversial mission accomplished speech by president george w bush in  in which he announce an end to major combat in iraq rice said obviously its a major milestone and its one we all should be welcoming quite plainly but it doesnt mean that the fight against isis is over and it doesnt mean that we can declare mission accomplished and just walk away what weve seen time and time again in this part of the world is that when the pressure is relieved on terrorist organizations whether al qaeda or isis they are able to reconstitute so we need to be vigilant we need to maintain a minimal presence in order to ensure that the pressure stays on isis and they dont come back roaring follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen
preliminary data released by the centers for disease control cdc over the summer suggest the rate of drug overdose deaths is declining or at least has begun to plateau as health and human services secretary alex azar put it last week we are so far from the end of the epidemic but we are perhaps at the end of the beginning azar said at a health care event in washington overdose deaths will likely be about  percent higher over the past two years when the final numbers for  are in leaving them a good  percent higher than they were at the dawn of the current crisis in  the good news is that the past seven months have seen what time called a promising if modest recent downturn if the final data bear this trend out it will be a welcome change from a trend that seemed to get worse with every passing year azar credited better access to medications that treat addiction and the lifesaving drug naloxone which helps victims dying of an overdose to resume breathing normally azar noted that while a stunning amount of potentially addictive pain medication is still prescribed to americans  far beyond the amount necessary to combat any conceivable increase of chronic pain since   prescriptions are slightly down from their peak in  and there has been a statistically significant decline in the number of americans who misuse prescription opioids since  even the number of americans initiating heroin use has declined and yet overdose deaths kept increasing until the possible plateau detected by cdc over the past few months the elephant in the room went unmentioned by alazar whose speech was almost entirely focused on programs to reduce dependency on prescription drugs but the associated press read between the lines and saw the bloodthirsty demon lurking there while prescription opioid and heroin deaths appear to be leveling off deaths involving fentanyl cocaine and methamphetamines are on the rise fentanyl is a synthetic opioid much more powerful than heroin used as an additive in street drugs the la times explained how the fentanyl supply chain works in an october  profile of the shanghai based zheng syndicate which ships fentanyl and other dangerous chemicals around the world and leaving a trail of corpses in its wake nearly  people died last year in the united states from overdoses linked to synthetic opioids a category that experts say is dominated by fentanyl and its chemical cousins  a staggering surge from the  such deaths reported in  one reason for the spike the drug is so powerful that a sugar packet sized bag of fentanyl can contain  lethal doses that also means it can be smuggled through the mail in what officials call micro shipments that are far harder to identify and interdict than bulkier loads of heroin cocaine or marijuana chinese companies send fentanyl in small quantities to dealers in the united states or canada but ship the drugs in bulk to criminal cartels in mexico the cartels then mix the synthetics into heroin and other substances or press them into counterfeit pills the product is then smuggled across the border while total fentanyl seizures more than doubled last year to  pounds officials say far more of the illicit drug is getting through some of the biggest fentanyl seizures have been in california because of the mexican connection fentanyl is so powerful that hundreds of fatal overdoses can be crammed into a container the size of a sugar packet its manufacturers operate beyond the reach of us law in china whose government is not exactly chomping at the bit to shut down operations that ruin and terminate thousands of american lives cartels in central and south america are big customers using fentanyl as rocket fuel to juice up the products they ship across the us border but there are plenty of domestic buyers too and they can manufacture so many pills with such tiny amounts of fentanyl that independent dealers with no connection to major cartels are popping up all over the country they can order fentanyl from china on the dark web pay in bitcoin and make a fortune selling pills created in household labs the la times mentioned a former eagle scout in utah who sold hundreds of thousands of pills and raked in over a million dollars by turning his moms basement into a drug lab chinas fentanyl industry is far more brazen than old school drug cartels their websites have flash sales and offer money back guarantees like hells answer to amazoncom when police investigators contacted a few overseas dealers online to inquire about fentanyl purchases but placed no orders the dealers proactively followed up sometimes offering deeper discounts to entice a sale bodies usually start dropping within weeks of fentanyl powered entrepreneurs opening for business in american towns the november issue of reason includes an editorial chastising congress for focusing far too heavily on the overprescription hypothesis when a wrongheaded crusade against prescription drugs arguably made the carnage from overdoses much worse by herding users away from pharmaceutical products and into the waiting arms of street dealers and their vastly more dangerous wares the suffering inflicted on pain patients who legitimately need medication is increasingly horrendous as well now that the medical profession has swung from overprescribing painkillers to people who exaggerated their pain levels to under prescribing meds for people in genuine agony secretary azar mentioned the surge of reported pain levels as a precursor to the opioid epidemic and touted plans to avoid exposing new patients to opioids a strategy that will hopefully reduce the number of people who are exposed to opioids through prescriptions and then turn to street dealers the questions that must be faced squarely is how many fatal overdose victims began with prescription drugs and how they obtained those pills the white house signaled its understanding of the street drug crisis and fentanyl death machine by touting provisions in the support act recently signed by president donald trump one of the measures included in the act is intended to make it harder for overseas labs to abuse the us postal service by using it to deliver drugs and chemicals to american customers the problem with americas policy response to the opioid crisis has always been the eagerness of politicians to embrace convenient diagnoses and sell expensive legislative solutions at a profit they dont like to discuss intractable social problems caused by foreign malefactors who cannot be dragged into american courtrooms for multi million dollar settlements the reduction in overdose deaths so slight that it might not be happening at all does not represent a tremendous return on the investments made

it took only  short years for new zealand singer lorde to succumb to the corruption of celebrity and align herself with bigotry and antisemitism this week she canceled her planned june  concert in israel and joined the boycott divestment sanctions bds movement which seeks the economic annihilation of the state of israel in choosing to align herself with those committed to israels fiscal destruction lorde broke with some of the greatest names in modern music including lady gaga justin timberlake rihanna radiohead and sir paul mccartney who in  played to an audience of  people in tel aviv despite receiving death threats when i was michael jacksons rabbi his strong feelings for the jewish community meant he was even prepared to suffer professionally for his love of israel and the jewish people in  michael went to israel on his dangerous tour where he performed for  fans in tel aviv in late  a jewish philanthropist called me and told me that israeli prime minister ariel sharon was coming to his home that night for a reception he asked if michael jackson would come there and meet with the prime minister i turned to michael in the presence of some of his professional staff and asked him if he would like to meet the israeli prime minister michael immediately jumped at the opportunity and told me he would love to do so however the people who surrounded him at the time mentioned that it might not be a good idea they said that sharon was hated in many parts of world especially in arab nations a photograph of michael with ariel sharon could spark a significant backlash including a boycott of michaels albums and music michael dismissed their concerns and said that he felt very excited to meet the prime minister a few minutes later we embarked in michaels van and crossed town to the meeting the pictures of michael greeting prime minister sharon along with me and our mutual friend uri geller were published throughout the world michaels professional staff were correct the very next day websites called for a boycott of michaels music saying that he supported israels hated leader michael didnt care he loved israel and the jewish people and he was thrilled to meet israels democratically elected leader thats why its so sad to see a pop star like lorde going over to the dark side of bigotry and antisemitism at such a young age even more hypocritical was her announcement that she would be keeping her engagements in putins russia that global font of nobel prize grade humanitarianism lordes decision to play in russia which has backed the murder of  arabs in syria under bashar al assad makes a mockery of her tour and will forever undermine any legitimate pretense she might otherwise have had to be a human rights activist the zionist federation of new zealand put it well when they condemned lorde for joining the ranks of those who wish to see the destruction of israel  by singling out israel amongst other nations whose human rights abuses make any that israel supposedly commit seem a drop in the ocean shows the double standards and discrimination towards the jewish state of those in the bds movement just in case lorde may be reading this column has a conscience and is interested in repentance lets be clear the sole purpose of bds is to destroy israel it has no interest whatsoever in palestinian rights if it did it would be boycotting egypt for destroying hundreds of palestinian homes on the gaza border in october  to stop hamas from smuggling weapons if bds was about palestinian rights it would be boycotting palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas for becoming a dictator and running a kleptocracy in the palestinian authority if bds were about palestinian rights it would be boycotting hamas for its honor killings and assassinations of palestinians who protest its vile and brutal rule bds has no interest in protecting arab life if it did it would be boycotting syria for murdering half a million arabs bds has no interest in protesting an occupation if it did it would be boycotting china for occupying tibet since  the longest occupation in the modern world bds has no interest in promoting arab human rights if it did it would be divesting from qatar jordan saudi arabia egypt syria lebanon and every other arab country where arabs are denied the most basic rights like freedom of press freedom to protest their government and the freedom to vote all of which are guaranteed to arabs only in israel bds trades in antisemitism by trivializing human rights abuses in any country but democratic israel bds has nothing to say of the persecution of the rohingya in myanmar the hanging of gays in iran the honor killings of women in pakistan and the political imprisonment of tens of thousands of political prisoners in turkey as far as intent bds stands for brutally destroy semites with the semites in question being jews lorde do you not understand that joining the anti semitic bds movement has brought you into serious discredit do you not understand that you are emboldening israels enemies like iran hamas and hezbollah all of whom seeks israels physical destruction lorde you are young but youth is not excuse for anti semitism and bigotry might i suggest that you look to your elder in music legendary lady gaga who said to the massive crowd of israelis at her  concert in israel ani ohevet etchem i love you she closed off her songs with the words todah rabah thank you very much best of all she told the crowd put your hands up and cheer for yourselves you are strong you are brave you are confident and i fking love you israel the expletive might have been unnecessary but her commitment to a country that is the foremost bastion of human rights in the middle east was downright incredible perhaps its time for lorde to ask guidance from the lord and try and fix a severely broken moral and spiritual compass rabbi shmuley boteach americas rabbi whom the washington post and newsweek call the most famous rabbi in america is the international bestselling author of  books including his most recent the israel warrior follow him on twitter rabbishmuley please let us

clevelandthe republican party platform approved by the platform committee this week in cleveland adopted donald trumps call for a security wall on americas southern border as part of the solution to the nations broken immigration system as well as safeguarding national security republican party staffers prepare a first draft of the platform for delegates to use as a starting point for debate a draft based on the previous conventions platform in this case the  platform updated to account for current issues these staffers had already included language in the first draft calling for construction of a physical barrier on what it called our vulnerable borders but some delegates noted that a physical barrier could mean all manner of things from a chain link fence to a series three foot high concrete blocks like americans typically see on construction sites or around sensitive government buildings the delegates decided to remove all ambiguity replacing it with donald trumps words calling for the construction of a wall the platform specifies that the security wall should secure the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic kansas secretary of state kris kobacha prominent constitutional lawyer and former law professor whom some conservatives in cleveland this week hope to see considered for us attorney general in a trump administrationintroduced the amendment to explicitly call for an actual wall kobach was one of the elected officials who endorsed trump early in the primary process in large part due to trumps strong stand on securing the border for me the most important issue in the republican presidential contest is immigration and its effect on our national security kobach said on february  when he announced his endorsement on that issue mr trump stands head and shoulders above the other candidates our porous borders constitute a huge national security threat kobachs statement continued and our refugee system has been abused by terrorists in the past and is likely to be abused by isis terrorists today americas immigration crisis is also an economic issue kobach noted as too many americans are out of work because of illegal immigration this border wall amendment was one of many that kobach successfully added to the draft platform this week working with other conservative leaders among the delegates speaking exclusively to breitbart news today kobach explained the border wall needs to be a real wall not a fake wall consisting of sensors in the ground the time for action has come he added because the american people have been wanting this for years if mr trump is elected it will finally happen the platform will be formally adopted in its final form by the platform committee on monday and then presented to the full republican national convention and the gops presidential nominee ken klukowski is senior legal editor for breitbart news follow him on twitter kenklukowski comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page
wednesday on the hugh hewitt show incoming white house chief of staff reince priebus said many white house press traditions will change under president donald trump partial transcript as follows hewitt last two questions have to do with the media first of all instead of that boring saturday morning radio address i think the president should do a friday morning drive time nationally syndicated show each week you know in the morning when you can shape news dont you agree priebus well you know what look i think that many things have to change and i think that its important that we look at all of those traditions that are great but quite frankly as you know dont really make news hewitt no priebus and theyre just sort of hewitt its horrible priebus mundane boring episodes and you know even looking at things like the daily white house briefing from the press secretary i mean theres a lot of different ways that things can be done and i can assure you were looking at that hewitt and that brings me glenn thrush on wednesday said there is worry in the white house press corps that theyre going to do away with the traditional bullpen the upstairs the downstairs now i do want the front row given over to salem media but what do you what are the plans for the press corps and that traditional approach priebus were and i hate blowing things off because im not doing it on purpose it just so happens that were actually talking about those things right now and what the new tradition i guess you could say should be in the trump white house you know this was the first front row assigned seat issue as i understand it started in the obama administration in the bush administration you just took a seat and i guess there were a couple of people that have had reserved spots but for the most part the more formalized reserved seating piece came in over the last eight years that issue is being talked about the point of all of this conversation is that the traditions while some of them are great i think its time to revisit a lot of these things that have been done in the white house and i can assure you that change is going to happen even on things that might seem boring like this topic but also change as far as how were going to approach tax reform the american worker how we protect them and business all at the same time why skyrocketing our economy hewitt reince priebus again congratulations make sure in that change they put that hugh hewitt chair right there in the middle of the front row we appreciate you being here priebus you got it follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
sunday on msnbc network host al sharpton said in light of allegations of an affair with a porn star and the access hollywood tape evangelical leaders who supported president donald trump should have their integrity questioned sharpton said i mean i think when you look at the access hollywood tape when you look at even president trumps comments about other people based on other than the christian religion his islamophobia and all i think to give all of that a pass the evangelical leaders i think is to really begin to question the integrity of some of them that have presented themselves as these leaders of faith and belief that will give people a pass based on their wanting access to power i think it is very unfortunate follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

on thursdays broadcast of nprs morning edition dnc deputy chair representative keith ellison d mn argued that president trump uses twitter in a manner that is comparable to the behavior of englands king george iii ellison argued that twitter should block trump from twitter and that he cant think of anyone whos been more abusive than donald trump he added that there should at least be a discussion about the presidents twitter use and that if twitter evaluates trumps account and concludes that he hasnt violated any of twitters terms of use id be satisfied with that ellison later argued that he generally sees twitter as a good thing to foster communication from your government but i think it can be used in a very bad way because what hes doing through his twitter account and in other ways is circumventing the whole system to intimidate people to pack courts to intimidate the press all so that he can just sort of run everything himself and we fought a war of independence against somebody king george who was trying to do that so this is really why im actually kind of concerned about his use of social media not the fact that he uses it thats actually a good thing but the way that he uses it i think is damaging to representative democracy ht wfb follow ian hanchett on twitter ianhanchett please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

the department of homeland security has put hundreds of thousands of central american migrants on a fast track to jobs and a slow track to deportation the revelation was hidden in a brief statement by acting dhs secretary kevin mcaleenan who told the senate on may  hearing that  percent of migrants carrying children are released some without asking for asylum and are allowed to get work permits as soon as  days the dhs is releasing the migrants on the fast track process because they do not have the space to detain migrants long enough to start the deportation process said andrew arthur a former immigration judge who works at the center for immigration studies a washington dc based research congress will not fund shelters to hold more than  migrants with children so it is allowing the border agencies to be overwhelmed by the rush of migrants the slow track deportation process allows migrants to delay filing their likely asylum request  and so it delays the eventual rejection of the asylum claim which is needed prior to deportation rather than potential starting their asylum process while in custody at the border they are not going to take pleadings until they are in subsequent removal proceedings said arthur in contrast the regular process allows migrants to be deported in roughly  days if border officials can quickly record and process asylum claims starting with a credible fear interview meanwhile the fast track job process allows migrants to get work permits as quickly as  days after crossing the border the conventional process bars migrants who ask for asylum from applying for work permits for  days the conventional process also allows government officials another  days to approve the request so boosting the conventional work permit process up to  days the conventional  day process takes six months to get a work permit  but dhs has been giving work permits to the migrants in just one to three months the fast trackslow track process means that employers quickly get an extra supply of tough compliant low wage workers just as labor shortages are forcing companies to boost pay for americans the extra labor supply also reduces employers incentive to hire the population  million unemployed or underemployed americans some of whom are sidelined by disability underinvestment in rural areas or drugs mcaleenan exposed the easy migration rules when he answered questions from ohio republican sen rob portman portman so what percent of those families who come up to the border and again approach your officer ask for asylum are being released into the community within days mcaleenan  percent portman  percent mcaleenan yeah and theyre not necessarily asking for asylum they  they dont  they dont have to they can go into an immigration proceeding and not have to present that case for potentially years  portman and during that time period can those individuals work mcaleenan yes by and large although werewere looking atat tightening thethe rules so that there is not an opportunity to take advantage of the system portman so they have a work permit my understanding is they dont get the work permit immediately but after a certain period of time is it six weeks mcaleenan its in  the  to  days range thats correct mcaleenan suggested that the border agencies will try to delay the award of work permits to migrants that task however requires getting more migrants back into the regular bureaucratic process the regular process quickly assigns migrants in the deportation process but most migrants counter by asking for asylum in response the ice agents at short term shelters near the border conduct a credible fear interview to gauge the migrants asylum claims almost  out of  migrants pass the low bar interview under rules set by congress and are then given a notification to appear at a hearing before an immigration judge next migrants cite a separate law which allows them to apply for a work permit if they have not had their hearing in  days but dhs officials are not processing the migrants via the conventional process instead they are paroling the migrants with children into the united states even before they undergo a credible fear interview and get a nta once released via parole a different law allows migrants to quickly apply for a work permit mcaleenan did not say how many migrants apply for the work permits or how long the work permits last but agency data shows a huge volume of migrants getting work permits from october  to september  for example  migrants got work permits via the c process and another  migrants got paroled and got work permits via the paroled pursuant to ina d category in the next fiscal year of  the regular number spiked to  but the parole number dropped to  as trumps deputies curbed the parole number in  the regular number dipped to  and the parole number lurched down to  dhs officials have refused to tell breitbart news how long the work permits last are hiding the number of migrants getting new work or extended work permits but mcaleenens comments suggest that the parole number is rising fast in  nancy pelosi is promising to raise wages via gov t socialism but trump s hire american immigrationlabor supply policy is nudging wages up by   percent a year yes politicians competing over rival wage raising policies would be a great thing httpstcothxhoarnz  neil munro neilmunrodc may   the overall award of work permits is huge  and it is roughly equal to one extra migrant worker for every  americans who joined the labor force in  and  the rush of migrants has spiked in  because the cartels the migrants the border agencies and the voters know that congress is refusing to block the catch and release loopholes which are delivering hundreds of thousands of cheap workers to their political allies and their donors the migration may reach  in the  months up to october that number includes at least  extra workers and at least  children for placement in k  schools used the children of americas blue collar communities more than  million americans remain unemployed underemployed or out of the labor force but wanting a job tight labor market still has some slack httpstcogpdbiucgje  john binder  jxhnbinder april   the underlying problem is that california judges set a  day flores limit on the detention of migrants who bring their children said arthur this means each wave of migrants with children can easily overcome the border rules ensuring they get released into the us job market arthur said the problems that we see at the border are the result of one decision from the th circuit  it is preposterous that it has come to this and it needs to be fixed asap congress has abdicated its responsibility and the administration has to do it in regulation and the administration needs to be prepared to defend this in court because that is where it is going the regulation to replace the flores decision is likely to be published soon he said adding needless to say this is the key to the kingdom background immigration numbers this years inflow of up to one million illegal migrants from central american is only a small slice of the immigration economy each year roughly four million young americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university but the federal government then imports about  million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of roughly  million white collar visa workers  including roughly one million h b workers  and approximately  blue collar visa workers the government also prints out more than one million work permits for foreigners tolerates about eight million illegal workers and does not punish companies for employing the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants who sneak across the border or overstay their legal visas each year this policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth for investors because it ensures that employers do not have to compete for american workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions this policy of flooding the market with cheap foreign white collar graduates and blue collar labor shifts also enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors even as it also widens wealth gaps reduces high tech investment increases state and local tax burdens and hurts childrens schools and college educations it also pushes americans away from high tech careers and sidelines millions of marginalized americans including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions the labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the heartland to the coastal cities explodes rents and housing costs shrivels real estate values in the midwest and rewards investors for creating low tech labor intensive workplaces acting dhs sec kevin mcaleenan defends his agency s policy of upgrading  but not extending  the border walls also his list of priorities pointedly does not include the enforcement of the laws barring wage cutting illegals from us workplaces httpstcojjshnlafm  neil munro neilmunrodc may   please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

a new poll makes clear donald trump can win this election if he keeps hammering on the anvil that is hammering with the same hammer on the same anvil for the next five months the anvil of course is the basic issue of homeland security and the hammer is the action needed to keep the country safe the latest reuters poll asks agreedisagree the united states should temporarily stop all muslims from entering the united states agree is  disagree is  in other words trump now has the benefit of an eight point advantage on the central question of muslim entry into the us  a question made even more central in the wake of the orlando mass murder in politics theres a time for creativity and poetry and spontaneity but more often that not politics is akin to warfare  you win by slugging it out that is its a simple question of ordnance which side can put more firepower toward the other side thereby doing the most damage okay thats a boring to say nothing of bloody way of looking at the situation but the end goal victory is not boring and that reuters poll tantalizes us if trump can stay focused on the single issue of muslim immigration for the next five months  do you want more syrian refugees and potentially more omar mateens coming in the country or not  he will not only win but win handily that is if  and once again its necessary to stipulate the if  he can focus on that pressure point he will win the american people are with him on that key issue and so now he must rally them to that issue he must put the question bluntly which side are you its that simple indeed worldwide the dominoes of trumpian nationalist populism are tumbling away from the trans national globalists in countries as different as india israel the philippines russia and turkey nationalist populists are winning elections  usually in landslides one neednt be a fan of all those foreign leaders to recognize nonetheless the populist trend meanwhile in less than two weeks britons go to the polls to vote on brexit the latest surveys indicate that the english will finally vote their independence from the bureaucrat  and jihadi infested european union that will be another epic defeat for the international bureaucrats finally here at home the trans pacific partnership the obama administrations last attempt at imposing more bureaucratic corporate globalism on the american people seems dead  and will be dead for sure if trump wins so yes the stakes are high yet theyve been high in the past as well and america has come through a century and a half ago back in  the norths general grant had the souths general robert e lee cornered around spotsylvania in central virginia the southerners were well entrenched defending themselves on their own home turf yet grant planned to win no matter what the cost and he had the edge in men and materiel so it was just a question of sticking to the plan and squeezing lee like an anaconda or to switch metaphors hammering lee on the anvil of union steel as grant wrote in one of his dispatches i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer and thats what he did lees men were brave and fought well but they were badly outnumbered and so grant dogged and determined as always played his hand to victory so with ulysses s grant as an inspiration maybe donald j trump can do it too comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page
wednesday on msnbcs live host katy tur questioned brett kavanaughs attorney beth wilkinson about the latest allegation against her client from michael avenattis client julie swetnick partial transcript as follows tur these latest rounds are extraordinarily serious your client says he doesnt know mrs swetnick he calls the allegations ridiculous and from the twilight zone is your client  confident hes never met her wilkinson he doesnt know her hes never met her we had people calling our office saying they dont know her theyve never seen her at the parties that they attended with him when you think about the allegations they are alleging that for years there were gang rapes going on with multiple men multiple women being victims thats such a frightening allegation i dont understand how her lawyer didnt go immediately to the police and back then why people wouldnt have said something we understand why women dont generally report sexual assault and they often dont talk about it for a long time but this a quantum leap different this is a frightening allegation that there were groups of boys with groups of girls over two years involved in drinking drugs and gang rape and no one ever went to the police no one has gone to the police to this day to report those allegations its truly outrageous tur are you calling her a liar wilkinson im not calling her a liar i think she has known about this for a while supposedly and so has mr avenatti he waved this on some of your programs since last weekend and said he knew about it and he never went to the police as an attorney i know what my obligation is its to my client and if i had represented her it would have been my duty to go to the police immediately and report this if this is true it is a horrible thing theres nothing that could have stopped mr avenatti from going to the fbi or the police to start an investigation on his own as far as i can tell from reading this that wasnt done tur all the women who have accused your client of misconduct have one similar thing in common they all say he drank to excess there are other folks out there from his high school years and from his college years who say the same thing he drank to excess your client also admits he did at some times have a few too many beers if thats the case and if theres a potential out there for him being black out drunk or very drunk how is he confident of his memories wilkinson first of all almost every high school and college student could be accused of the same thing or have done had drinks had too many drinks thats not the same as being black out drunk and not remembering this he knows that he didnt know this woman shes not saying its once shes saying its over two years this wasnt a one time thing thats the same with the other two women all the people who are supposedly there in those instances have said it didnt happen or they dont have any recollection theres not one person who is saying they were there in each of the incidents theres groups of people that were identified as present thats not typical in these allegations normally its one man and one woman and its hard to determine here especially in the most recent outrageous allegation theres scores of people involved for years tur why is your client not demanding an fbi investigation to get to the bottom of this wilkinson he didnt know about this until it came out today mr avenatti has had this information for weeks tur is he now demanding an fbi investigation wilkinson he knows he didnt do it tur why doesnt he want an fbi investigation if theres multiple people who can go on the record or go under oath or be interviewed by the fb why would he not want the fbi to get involved wilkinson thankfully our system doesnt work the way youre suggesting tur this is a job interview its two different things wilkinson its out here in the public opinion and what youre doing is a perfect example youre claiming because he was drinking he must have done it tur i asked you about his memory dont put words in my mouth i asked if he was confident of his memories thats all i asked wilkinson i heard your last session and you were saying theres so much detail theres no detail in here theres no place theres one or two years generally theres no other people theres no dates theres no times theres no information there are multiple people supposedly involved within several years not just her she saw other women being gang raped and its never been reported i dont know what the lawyer did and i feel sorry for her for getting dragged into this and any other woman getting dragged into it but that doesnt mean the accusations are true this is a horrible commentary on our process this is what were putting people through who wants to be in public service its important to treat everybody in the process with dignity and giving them the presumption of innocence whether youre inside a courtroom or outside tur let me read you something the president said about this this morning you dont find people like this hes outstanding hes a gem and hes being treated unfairly by the democrats who are playing a con game they laugh at what they are getting away with does your client believe its a con game by the democrats that these women are part of a con by the democrats and that the democrats are laughing in a back room about what they are able to pull off wilkinson my client knows that he didnt do this hes not speculating about all those things what he knows is all of his friends and family all say this isnt like him nobody corroborates one of these allegations that they saw this happen or were in the room even the lady who knows dr blasey and was friendly with her and was in the same party says shes never met judge kavanaugh hes not speculating about the politics what hes telling you is what he knows he did not do this tur does your client believe any of the accusers against the president wilkinson does he what tur does he believe any of the women who came out and accused the president of sexual misconduct wilkinson i dont know what that has to do with this ive never discussed that with him were talking about whats happening here i came today to be on your program to tell you what he believes and what we know thats it im not here to make political arguments and comment on what the president said or didnt say the point is someone is making these outrageous allegations about him with no detail over multiple years with multiple people and hes telling you he did none of it he doesnt know her ive had people call me and email me saying they know him theyve never met her theyve never seen her and never heard of any of these allegations ive got to believe if this was happening over two years someone else would have heard about it and reported it not the day before the hearing hes had an entire hearing a background investigation none of these people including mr avenattis client came forward until the day before the hearing tur does he believe dr ford is lying wilkinson he doesnt believe anyone is lying or not lying all he can say is what he knows he did not do this hes never engaged in that behavior he was a normal kid he played sports he was a good student he drank beers and sometimes he said things he regrets and cringes at like all of us but that is very different than saying did you engage in a sexual assault absolutely not he did not do that follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

the us economy added  million jobs in june and the unemployment rate fell to  percent both better than expected the economy has added around  million jobs in the past two months the increase in the ranks of employed workers shows that companies ramped up hiring as the economy reopened and consumers came back to stores restaurants and other businesses that had been shuttered in march and april job growth was strong in restaurants and bars reflecting the reopening of those establishments across the country which added  million jobs the labor department said thursday but employment remains  million below februarys level the month before the pandemic hit the us economy retail stores added  there were big gains in clothing stores furniture stores department stores and auto dealerships despite the gains total employment is around  million below februarys level manufacturing employment rose by  but is down by  since february june employment increases were concentrated in the durable goods component with the auto sector adding  jobs accounting for over half of the job gain in manufacturing construction employment increased by  in june following a gain of  in may employers added the jobs even as much of the country was beset by urban riots looting of commercial districts and marches by self styled black lives matter activists calling for the defunding of police and the toppling of statues of political leaders from americas past despite the increase in the number of employed workers there are still tens of millions fewer americans working today than february compared with a year ago there are  million fewer jobs in the us and a separate report on thursday showed that over  million americans were laid off last week the fifteenth week in a row of one million plus new claims for unemployment benefits but the thirteenth week in a row of declining claims the previous weeks level of jobless claims was revised up by  from  to  economists had been expecting around  million new jobs although the range of estimates was unusually wide due to the unprecedented nature of the shutdown and reopening estimates ranged from  million jobs to more than  million the unemployment rate was expected to fall to  percent from  percent a report on private payrolls from adp and moodys analytics on wednesday estimated that businesses increased their workforces by  million in june the estimate for may which initially showed a loss of  million jobs was revised to show a gain of  million the governments nonfarm payroll data which covers both private and public sector workers showed the economy gaining  million jobs in may far more than expected and indicating an accelerated pace of the recovery the number of unemployed people who were out of the labor but rejoined in june rose by  to  million the labor force participation rate increased by  percentage points in june to  percent but is  percentage points below its february level total employment as measured by the household survey rose by  million to  million in june the employment population ratio at  percent rose by  percentage points over the month but is  percentage points lower than in february average hourly wages are up  percent compared with a year ago although they fell  percent compared with may average wages often rise at times of mass layoffs when lower paid employees are more likely to lose their jobs the average workweek slipped from  hours to  hours the number of unemployed persons who were on temporary layoff decreased by  million in june to  million following a decline of  million in may but this was more than offset by an increase in the number of permanent job losers which rose by  to  million in june its likely that some people who considered themselves only temporarily laid off now realize they have been permanently cut the trump administrations aid programs appear to be working direct relief payments to taxpayers and enhanced unemployment have kept incomes up despite the huge rise in unemployment which in turn has boosted demand for consumer products the paycheck protection progam which provides forgivable loans to small businesses that avoid layoffs also seems to have supported employment and rehiring while some in washington dc may see the better than expected job figures as a reason to pull back on the aid or decline to extend enhanced unemployment benefits past their end of july expiration a stronger case can be made for extending aid that has played such a crucial role in helping the labor market recover without the loans relief payments and unemployment enhancement it is unlikely consumer demand would support such high levels of hiring withdrawing the support prematurely would risk a second stage collapse in employment white house economic adviser larry kudlow on thursday said the moment for enhanced unemployment payments had passed the administration is working on ways to modify the unemployment enhancement so that it does not create a disincentive to work by paying people more in benefits than they earned on the job that could include stepping down the enhancement from  a week which is paid on top of regular state unemployment benefits to a lower level perhaps  per week another possible solution explored by the administration would be to transform the enhancement into a back to work bonus that would continue to be paid when work resumed kudlow and others inside the white house have referred to this as a re employment bonus that could replace the unemployment bonus on wednesday president donald trump said he supported a fresh round of relief payments and indicated that he would increase their size from the  paid in the prior round the monthly figures are constructed from data collected mid month in this case the week ended june  as a result they may not reflect any slowdown that may have been caused by a renewed surge of coronavirus infections and backtracking on reopenings in some states later in the month with confirmed coronavirus cases spiking across the sun belt a range of evidence suggests that a nascent recovery is stalling in states that are suffering the sharpest spikes in reported virus cases  texas florida arizona and others  progress has reversed with businesses closing again and workers losing jobs in some cases for a second time on wednesday california re closed down bars theaters and indoor restaurant dining across most of the state and arizonas outbreak grew more severe by nearly every measure florida has closed some beaches there is mixed evidence about the pace of the recovery in the second half of june jobless claims remained stuck at the elevated level of around  million suggesting that economic growth may have stalled but survey data from manufacturers and indicators of consumer spirits point to ongoing economic progress credit and debit card data tracked by jpmorgan chase show that consumers have slowed their spending in just the past week after spending had risen steadily in late april and may the reversal has occurred both in states that have seen surges in reported covid cases and in less affected states said jesse edgerton an economist at jp morgan nationwide card spending fell nearly  last week compared with a year ago that was worse than the previous week when year over year card spending had declined just under  real time data from homebase a provider of time tracking software for small businesses shows that the number of hours worked at its client companies has leveled off after having risen sharply in may and early june business re openings have also flattened the economic bounce produced by the initial lifting of shutdown orders may have run its course mobility data based on apple maps routing requests shows ongoing growth in driving and walking although mass transit appears to remain depressed data on reservations and walk ins from open table showed an increase immediately following reopenings around the country but little progress in recent weeks likely a reflection of the fact that many restaurants are operating at just fractional capacity indeed at around  percent below last years levels this could be an indication of restaurants operating near maximum capacity tsa data shows airline passenger numbers have continued to climb throughout june nearly doubling in the month home sales have proved strong with pending home sales in may jumping much higher than expected and lumber demand climbing it is unlikely the economy will continue to add nearly  million jobs in the months ahead in part because the number of unemployed available for work is shrinking so future months will be likely to show smaller jobs gains even if the recovery continues the associated press contributed to this report please

a spokesman for zanu pf the ruling socialist party in zimbabwe reportedly dismissed the american presidential election as a circus on monday and falsely accused president donald trump of saying all africans were assholes zanu pf is the socialist party of late dictator robert mugabe who ruled for  years before his former underling emmerson mnangagwa orchestrated a coup in  mugabe once identified mnangagwa as a lead organizer of the gukurahundi the genocide of the ndebele people under mugabe in response to their opposition to his rule mugabe was and mnangagwa is a member of the shona ethnic group the zimbabwean regime has maintained an antagonistic relationship with the united states for decades american officials have sanctioned the regime for human rights abuses against its people most recently in march the spokesman condemning the american elections on monday patrick chinamasa called us ambassador to zimbabwe brian nichols a thug and uncle tom in remarks in july a response to washington opposing the arrest of peaceful dissidents for organizing a protest on monday chinamasa appeared to be celebrating trumps apparent loss in the november presidential election to challenger joe biden at a regular media briefing chinamasa complained that under trump america had become too vocal in supporting human rights and democracy the us administration of donald trump through its diplomat here in zimbabwe has behaved as if it is the headmaster of democratic societies chinamasa said according to the local outlet  chat who lied to his home country that our elections were not announced timeously causing the events of st august  where hooligans unleashed unprovoked terror and violence in the city centre supposedly demanding the release of election results barely  hours after voting the spokesman was referring to the presidential election of  in which the government hastily announced mnangagwa the winner on the evening of elections protests against the social regime erupted triggering widespread and disproportionate state violence against dissidents unfortunately zimbabwes success in delivering an election day that was peaceful and open to international observers was subsequently marred by violence and a disproportionate use of deadly force against protestors by the security forces us state department spokeswoman heather nauert said at the time we extend our condolences to the families and friends of those killed and injured and appeal to the leaders of all parties to urge their supporters to act peacefully the state departments  human rights report for zimbabwe described the election as not credible noting political parties and civil society organizations complained of widespread voter disenfranchisement including of foreign born and diaspora voters and the inability to compete on a level playing field following his complaints about a two year old election chinamasa then proceeded to mock the american elections results in the usa have by all standard turned into a circus from allegations of vote fraud to unbridled counts leading to a weeklong stalemate before election results will be announced despite there being a clear winner mr joe biden the spokesman said chinamasa said trump was famed for calling all africans as assholes without elaborating on this alleged fame on the presidents part the zanu pf spokesman was perhaps referring to a rumor published by the washington post in  that trump had referred to haiti el salvador and unnamed african countries as shithole countries trump denied the alleged remarks saying the language used by me  was tough but this was not the language used  never said anything derogatory about haitians other than haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country no reports have surfaced that trump has ever referred to all africans as assholes outgoing president donald trump famed for calling all africans as assholes has refused flatly to recognise the election outcome vowing to remain president chinamasa claimed this undemocratic agenda has found favour in his secretary of state and chief diplomat mike pompeo who has laughably vowed that there is going to be a transition to a second trump administration the trump administration has proved to be a threat to democracy and a global superpower and must be stopped chinamasa concluded demanding united nations action against america chinamasa used similar outrageous language against american ambassador nichols in july using the fact that he is black to refer to him as an uncle tom concerning the machinations and antics of the us ambassador brian nichols and a coterie of gangsters and mercenaries who are disguised as diplomats i want to warn them and remind them that it is high time they get to know that zimbabwe is a sovereign republic and we are a full sovereign state chinamasa declared diplomats should not behave like thugs and brian nichols is a thug what has the united states has to offer in terms of values and human rights observance when his own african american people are treated like rats in full view of world media and he nichols remains an uncle tom used to propagate values which by themselves they do not practice on their own people chinamasa asked at the time us assistant secretary of state tibor nagy responded to the outburst by describing chinamasas remarks as offensive but sadly not surprising mnangagwa regularly leaves these remarks to underlings in march for example his defense minister oppah muchinguri kashiri celebrated the chinese coronavirus outbreak in america as a punishment from god this coronavirus that has come are sanctions against the countries that have imposed sanctions on us god is punishing them now and they are staying indoors now while their economy is screaming like what they did to ours by imposing sanctions on us muchinguri kashiri said trump should know that he is not a god mnangagwa himself abstains from these remarks he was one of the first heads of state around the world to wish trump a speedy recovery following his coronavirus diagnosis in october while bidens democrat party has a friendlier relationship to socialists than the republicans zanu pf members have not expressed optimism in a biden administration if the democrat is inaugurated into office we will be surprised to see joe biden acting different from his predecessor donald trump if he does so we praise god zanu pf secretary for war veterans douglas mahiya told new zimbabwe after the election americans are americans they will remain white he said follow frances

a response sen susan collins r me gave during a senate debate this week when asked about systemic racism has attracted the attention of the left and its media allies collins during a debate with maine house speaker sara gideon d was told she had  seconds to respond to a question of whether systemic racism is a problem affecting maine collins replied in one sentence i do not believe systemic racism is a problem in the state of maine watch sen susan collins r me in the final maine senate debate with sara gideon is given  seconds to discuss whether systemic racism exists in her state collins gives a five second answer i do not believe systemic racism is a problem in the state of maine pictwittercomupncaiuahd  the recount therecount october   the question had come as a follow up to an earlier question about the black lives matter movement and the protests it has instigated across the country since the death of george floyd earlier this year referencing a recent one of the protests in scarborough the debate moderator first asked is the phrase black lives matter controversial and is there a systemic racism problem here in maine where  percent of people identify as white to which collins responded i dont think the phrase black lives matter should be controversial and i think that we are very fortunate in the state of maine because we have terrific members of law enforcement i am very fortunate to have the endorsement of the fraternal order of police i have met with first responders with police officers here in portland and elsewhere to thank them for their work for their bravery and i am pleased to support them at the same time its clear that in some parts of our country there is systemic racism or problems in police departments thats why i cosponsored sen tim scotts bill the justice act that would have brought about police reform regrettably it became the victim once again of partisan politics but certainly the horrific death of george floyd should horrify all of us and those responsible should be held accountable the debate moderator then delivered his follow up question is systemic racism a problem here in maine collins succinct one sentence response that maine does not have a systemic racism problem garnered incredulous reactions from leftists online with many saying she was ignorant senile uninformed a white idiot a dumb white woman whitesplaining a

tour on friday in a push to visit maines  counties before the november  election prior to that the democrat speaker pursued a tour to promote her expansive healthcare plan which includes creating a government run public option the debate this week was the final in the senate race and the first to feature only the top two of the four candidates on the ballot gideon is considered a frontrunner

tariffs have not pushed up consumer prices despite the claims of two flawed studies by federal reserve economists theres no evidence that consumers are paying higher prices for goods subject to tariffs on steel aluminum or chinese imports the consumer price index rose just  percent in may the department of labor said tuesday compared with a year ago prices rose just  percent after taking out volatile food and energy prices inflation ran at  percent for the month and o percent for the year both below economist expectations the federal reserves monetary policy committee says jt targets inflation at the rate of  percent but the index the fed uses called the personal consumption expenditure index runs about a half a point or so below the better known consumer price index which means that inflation is likely running below the feds target in other words even with the tariffs the trump administration has imposed consumer prices are rising by less than the fed thinks is consistent with price stability its theoretically possible prices would be rising at an even slower rate than they are if the tariffs were not in place but that would only mean the fed would have to work harder to push them back toward the target the data defy the dire predictions of experts who forecast consumers would foot the bill for tariffs   tariffs are about to hit consumers and it wont be pretty cnbc claimed commerce secretary wilbur ross however said all of these predictions of higher prices were wrong to the contrary ross argued tariffs would have little to no effect on us consumers he held up cans of campbells soup and budweiser beer to illustrate his point that the metals input into most consumer prices was very low and unlikely to rise when prices did not rise as predicted the critics did not back off their claims many just moved the time frame arguing that the forecast price increases were just taking time to move through the economy but with each passing month that an increasingly absurd position soup beer veggies and trucks take the prices of soup and beer secretary rosss examples the price of soup is up  percent compared with a year ago the price of beer consumer at home is up just  percent of course not all soup is canned beer is sold in bottles the government doesnt track canned beer and canned soup separately so it is possible that canned variations have seen more price inflation offset by price declines in bottled beer and soup in cardboard containers but thats largely irrelevant from the consumers perspective since shoppers can easily just switch to the cheaper category theres no upward pricing pressure on beer consumed in bars and restaurants which is notable because the price of beer kegs reportedly rose due to the aluminum tariffs beer consumed outside of the home is up just  percent compared with a year ago and has been falling for two months prices of canned fruits and vegetables another category of consumer goods that was widely predicted to see prices rise because of increased aluminum costs are up by  percent about double the overall price increase but very little of this is due to the price of aluminum instead its whats in the cans that is driving the price fresh vegetable prices are up  percent and were up  percent earlier this year so canned vegetables are up  percent fresh fruit prices are down  percent so canned fruit prices are up just  percent car and truck prices are perhaps the most important consumer item that tariff opponents claimed would be pushed up by the metals tariffs but these have hardly moved compared with a year ago car prices are up just  percent the price of new trucks is  percent higher than a year ago televisions computers and appliances many of the categories of consumer goods that are largely manufactured abroad also saw steep declines defying predictions that the china tariffs implemented last year would weigh on consumers tools and hardware were often cited by those promoting the tariffs are taxes on consumers narrative but prices on these are up just  percent compared with a year ago the prices of televisions have crashed in may television prices fell  percent this is the tenth consecutive monthly decline for televisions compared with a year ago television prices are off  percent this steep decline may reflect foreign manufacturers competing with each other for market share by dumping televisions on the us market there are no real domestic manufacturers for anti dumping regulations to protect so it is unlikely the commerce department will take any action here the price of computers digital homes assistants and phones were predicted to see upward pressure from tariffs on china but computers and related hardware prices are down  percent compared with last year phone prices fell again for at least the ninth consecutive month and are now down  percent compared with a year ago note that mobile phones were excluded from the first two rounds of china tariffs were now a year into the anti dumping tariffs imposed in january of last year on washing machines these were intended to drive up the price from artificially depressed levels and accomplished that goal last year those washing machine price gains however have faded laundry equipment is now down  percent compared with a year ago made in china  the tariffs on chinese made goods also do not seem to have had much of an effect on consumer prices initially the trump administration applied a  percent tariff to  billion of imports from china that was largely focused on technology goods in late september however the china tariffs were broadened to impose a  percent tax on an additional o billion and a wider array of consumer goods in may that  percent tariff rose to  percent its probably too early to tell if the  percent tariff will create additional price pressures but our experience with the  percent tariff level implies that these could be very minimal appliance prices are up just  percent compared with a year ago the narrower major appliance category which was pushed up by the sharp rise in washing machines saw a monthly decline of  percent compared with a year ago prices are now up just o percent a huge deceleration from februarys  percent gain that had goldman sachs and other claiming consumers were being squeezed by tariffs the prices of furniture and bedding one of the largest categories of china made imports and are up  percent annually this is actually an astonishingly low level of price inflation given the acceleration of home sales which are up more than  percent compared with last year toys another big china import category saw prices fall by a staggering  percent sports equipment prices are down  percent bicycles and other sports vehicles are up just  percent clothing prices are down  percent compared with a year ago auto parts and equipment prices are up just  percent compared with a year ago once again the consumer price data has largely demolished the notion that tariffs are squeezing consumers phones computers and especially televisions have plummeted in price beer soup and cars show no tariff pressure at all baseball mitts and other sports equipment are cheaper cars and trucks sell for just about what they did before tariffs were imposed that does not mean that prices will remain low or tariffs will never push prices up but it demonstrates that even after several months of tariffs prices on consumers are not rising those who predicted tariffmageddon for consumers owe secretary ross an apology please let us know if you re

on breitbart news daily monday morning joe borelli new york city councilman and donald trumps co chairman for the state said that while sen ted cruz has skillfully sewn up delegates in colorado and wyoming a blowout vote for trump in new york could make the senators victories irrelevant and crown trump as the partys nominee trump is probably going to win over  percent in the majority of the congressional districts around the state and i think he comes away with the vast majority of delegates he said and a week after that were in five northeastern states where we have  delegates that are at stake and by all polling it seems as though donald trump is going to go out with the lions share of those as well that brings him over the thousand mark so i think whether the public likes it or not theyre going to have to start warming to the fact that donald trump will be the presumptive nominee come the convention the criticisms are valid that the campaign did a poor job in some states rallying delegates around them borelli said and ted cruz to his credit had a great weekend but if were counting  delegates in wyoming as this monstrous victory for ted cruz  again what happens come tomorrow night when donald trump potentially has the ability to win all  delegates in this state hes done a tremendous job actually and has really started to develop his ground game he has the support of the majority of the upstate county chairmen who are the ones who would actually be doing the appointing of the delegates he continued so i think this just naturally parlays into the other northeastern states on tuesday where hes also trying to do the same thing recruiting county chairmen and state chairmen breitbart news daily airs from  am to  am est weekdays on siriusxm patriot  listen comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

on sundays broadcast of abcs this week rep val deming d fl said house democrats wont wait for testimony from trump administration insiders like former national security advisor john bolton and director of the office of management and budget mick mulvaney before proceeding on impeachment partial transcript as follows raddatz and as i just talked about with dan you have the mcgahn ruling which could affect bolton mulvaney important witnesses why not wait to see if they eventually could testify demings well what we have requested are documents from witnesses that have just mentioned the state department chief of staff we want to have those documents to review those documents that will help to lead any interview or testimony from those participants as you well know they have not been willing to obey lawful subpoenas that have been issued and look were not going to play any games with them the american people are not going to i think tolerate any games if theyre very serious about obeying lawful subpoenas then they need to respond to the request for documents and then obey those lawful subpoenas raddatz but couldnt there  it sounds to be critical to understanding whats happening i mean again why not  why not wait demings well as i said they have not been willing to really comply with lawful subpoenas they want to what i believe is to play a political game and tie the process of  in the court as long as they can and run the clock out were not willing to play that game we have requested documents those documents as you well know are critical and very valuable to the work before us and so if they comply with the document request i believe it shows the good faith effort on their part to further cooperate with the inquiry raddatz and congresswoman youve seen all the facts and evidence laid out from these impeachment hearings but no witness has personally attested that the president directly condition the release of military aid to investigation into his political opponent does that missing element really undermine the democratic argument demings let me tell you the best witness the most effective the most valuable witness that we have is the president of the united states himself with president zelensky on july th on the infamous call mentioned the fact that he was about ready to purchase additional weaponry president trump responded but i need you to do a favor though  and then went to what the conditions will be we know that every witness that we talked to none of the witnesses that weve talked to who had been directly involved or not were able to give any reasonable rational explanation for holding up the military aid and we do know that the aid was only released after congressional committees started asking questions and the whistleblower came forward and  crosstalk raddatz but then lets go back to that phone call given the president was ultimately unsuccessful in the quid pro quo as republicans argue the ukrainians never opposed the investigation the aid ultimately flowed and trump met with zelensky at the un should democrats consider a censure instead of the drastic step of impeachment demings well you know youre going to make me go back to my law enforcement experience i had an opportunity in  years to deal with a lot of people who attempted to rob a bank attempted to burglarize a house attempted to carjack an individual we didnt say well since you werent successful we caught you you werent successful so we just let you go and forget it no we have an obligation given to us by the constitution i know its one that the american people want us to uphold and we are going to do the work before us the fact that president caught  crosstalk raddatz but congresswoman  demings  the fact that the president got caught in the act does not relieve him of being held accountable for the wrongdoing that he has engaged in raddatz and congresswoman you talked about public opinion public opinion on support for impeachment has not increased through the hearing process theres not been a single house republican to join the democrats in this so how do you really move forward given what you said about the public demings well let me say you know were going to do the work before us just like as a law enforcement officer i never took a poll before i lived up to my responsibilities based on the oath that i took i have been extremely troubled and disappointed by the behavior of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle many of them i worked on committees with i worked on others legislation with i know them i have the utmost respect for them but their refusal to hold this president accountable and to clearly go into their partisan corner and protect this president at any and all cost is troubling to me and i believe is troubling to the american people follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

following the terrorist attack at pulse nightclub in orlando florida there has been a lot of discussion about the lgbt community and radical islam unfortunately its a conversation thats only happening on the right as democrats are still talking about banning guns when will they go to the middle east and have a sit in against tall buildings surely that will end their practice of executing gay men we shall overcome as long as theres air conditioning and were not in any danger ourselves when i was the director of cpac i introduced donald trump when he first spoke at the conference in  when trump spoke it was already a controversial conference because goproud a now defunct organization for gay conservatives and their allies was allowed to be one of over  participating organizations there were calls for boycotts mostly by groups that had never sponsored cpac and a few speakers who decided to decline their invitation because of goprouds inclusion not only did trump come to a conference that many in the mainstream media consider to be part of a fringe movement but he came at the invitation of goproud that year andrew breitbart also showed his support for goproud and their inclusion at cpac by cohosting their off site party despite the many reasons trump could have declined an invite from a group of gay conservatives he came and he stood with thousands of conservatives and proclaimed these are my people this statement is one key reason why the lgbt community should support trump also despite what the media will tell you many indeed do everyone knows milo but let me tell you about the og in gay conservative circles goproud cofounder chris barron is speaking out in support of trump in the general election and making the case for why he is a better choice than hillary clinton he started lgbtrump as a political player and commentator in washington dc for years barron and other gay conservatives have been told to hold their nose and vote they attended cpac attended republican national conventions and helped get out the vote in states across the country despite the national party not acknowledging them publicly for years barron and others have been good soldiers this is one of the reasons barron has no love for the never trump crowd without their hand picked candidate they dont want to play the role of the good soldier that weve been playing for years as their dream candidates declined barron said i described nevertrump as a king without an army now it appears they have no king either on cnncom barron made the case for why the lgbt community should support trump he wrote this act of war was perpetrated by an adherent to radical islam  an ideology that seeks the extermination of lgbt people worldwide for lgbt people in this country the stakes could not be any higher  or any more personal for lgbt americans this election wont be about bathrooms or who will bake our wedding cakes no this election will be about which of the candidates for president is willing to stand up and fight to defend our very right to life itself for the first time this isnt just a surrogate interpreting a republican candidates policy as pro gay or pro woman ie pro american while the candidate himself uses the same old talking points on wednesday trump gave a fantastic speech highlighting hillary clintons hypocrisy and her embrace of radical regimes trump said the father of the orlando shooter was a taliban supporter from afghanistan one of the most repressive anti gay and anti women regimes on earth i only want to admit people who share our values and love our people hillary clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death maybe her motivation lies among the more than  foreign donations hillary failed to disclose while at the state department trumps speech will go down in history as the end of the democrats self declared monopoly on the lgbt and womens vote comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

government and the united states was to negotiate the liberation of taliban jihadists and a return of islamic law to the country a  person delegation featuring at least four former guantnamo bay detainees represented the taliban at the talks attended by secretary of state mike pompeo and senior afghan government negotiator abdullah abdullah both pompeo and abdullah expressed enthusiasm that the talks would result in the full withdrawal of american troops from the region and thus an end to the longest war in american history spanning nearly two decades speaking to afghan news sources members of the taliban team expressed hope in seeing fellow members of the terrorist organization freed negotiations about the government and the release of remaining prisoners are the topics that will be on our agenda mohammad naeem wardak a taliban spokesperson told afghanistans khaama news the outlet quoted a negotiator on the afghan governments side massom stanekzai saying that he felt the talks had begun on a positive note and there wasnt any effort to drive the negotiations towards controversial discussions khaama interpreted wardaks remarks to mean the taliban was hopeful to see the  taliban jihadists in afghan custody freed wardak said at a meeting sunday evening in doha that establishing an islamic government in afghanistan and releasing  taliban prisoners are their agenda for the intra afghan negotiations according to sources mawlawi abdul kabir another member of the taliban negotiation team told the afghan news network tolo that his colleagues sought a return to a fully islamic afghanistan under sharia the islamic law and an end to the american and nato presence in the country established after the september   terrorist attacks we want a government in which the holy quran is ruling the hadith of the messenger muhammad is ruling the hanafi school is there and the occupation is over tolo quoted kabir as saying the taliban do not acknowledge the legitimacy of the government of afghanistan instead it considers itself the true government forced into exile by the us occupation it refers to itself as the islamic emirate of afghanistan tolo news described the backgrounds of each member of the taliban negotiating team including four with extensive stays in guantnamo bay after their capture mohammad fazel mazloom noorullah noori and abdul haq wasiq all spent  years at the us military detention center also on the list of negotiators is abdul manan omari the brother of taliban founder mullah omar the taliban have reason to be optimistic about the release of jihadist prisoners afghan president ashraf ghani has repeatedly green lit the release of significant numbers of taliban jihadists most recently reportedly approving the release of six taliban members considered at high risk for returning to the battlefield kabul transferred the six to doha where the taliban is headquartered ghani released another  taliban prisoners in august prior to that he issued a decree to release  in march and vowed to release another  in may the us afghan peace deal brokered in february reportedly required the release of up to  taliban jihadis and in turn  afghan government prisoners prior to official talks by july the afghan senate had verified that a significant number of those freed had returned to the battlefield speaking at a conference to open the peace talks in doha this weekend pompeo noted that the peace deal is contingent upon the taliban agreeing not to harbor members of international jihadist organizations that are a threat to the united states primarily al qaeda the talibans relationship with osama bin laden the late head of al qaeda responsible for the september  massacres triggered the us afghan war we welcome the taliban commitment not to host international terrorist groups including al qaeda nor to allow them to use afghan territory to train recruit or fundraise pompeo said in qatar we welcome the same commitments by the government of the islamic republic speaking to reporters including breitbart news on the journey to doha this weekend pompeo said the goal for america in these peace talks is to reduce our forces to zero as quickly as possible but that any troop reduction is contingent upon the taliban meeting their commitments in the agreement which include not only peace with america but not aiding terrorist groups at war with america afghanistan is also home to several other jihadist organizations including the local wing of the islamic state known as isis khorasan isis expanding into taliban territory and potentially threatening the talibans lucrative opium cultivation has led to significant violence between the groups experts do not believe the taliban enjoys a friendly relationship with islamic state jihadists though some have expressed concern that a peace deal may result in more fanatical members of the taliban defecting in relation to the talibans expressed hope of seeing a jihadist government once again take the reins of afghanistan the head of the afghan governments delegation abdullah used the opportunity to speak at the doha meeting to remind the world that afghanistan is already an islamic republic if not an emirate as the taliban desires ladies and gentlemen on the guidance of our sacred religion islam and on the basis of our free will and the right demands of our noble nation we have come to this country to achieve a dignified and lasting peace abdullah who was promoted to lead the talks after a bitter presidential race against ghani said in his remarks mullah abdul ghani

multiple polls of south korean citizens taken this week have found a drop in approval ratings for president moon jae in who has risked his legacy on a scheme to include north korea in next months winter olympics that may come at the price of some south korean athletes lifelong dream north and south korea have agreed to march in the olympics opening ceremony together and field a joint hockey team meaning some south korea athletes will be barred from participating in the olympics to make room for arguably less capable athletes from the north the excluded players have earned their spots and they think they deserve to go to the olympics south koreas female hockey team coach sarah murray said moon visited the distraught team on wednesday and told them that showing unity and hope may be more important than winning according to reuters the south korean newspaper joongang ilbo reported saturday local time on multiple polls finding the same trends regarding moons popularity a gallup kore poll found a  percent drop in approval in the past week down to  percent a survey by the agency realmeter found the same approval rating a  percent drop in one week joongang emphasizes that the drop in approval in the polls were larger among young voters and that recent polls on reunification with the north found an increased reticence among young south koreans to see themselves as part of a greater whole with north korea korea institute for national unification research director park ju hwa told the newspaper that their recent surveys show that unification based on homogenous identity no longer works as young koreans do not see north korea as part of their country this rejection of the communist north has made itself more apparent in public discourse as moon has imposed athletic unification with kim jong uns rogue state on friday reuters collected comments from locals in seoul and on social media that showed a reluctance to cooperate with the north and distrust in moons plans to bring the north back into the global community without demanding concessions on human rights and military belligerence north korea was all about firing missiles last year but suddenly they want to come to the south for the olympics who gets to decide that reuters quotes kim joo hee a  year old translator as saying on social media reuters found commenters complaining that the pyeongchang olympics have already become the pyongyang olympics and that the unification flag the countries will use in an attempt to not offend each other when marching into the opening ceremony is not my goddamned flag in an editorial published friday the chosun ilbo a south korean newspaper made similar complaints against the united front at the olympics how can we let the olympics become a propaganda opportunity for the worlds most oppressive state the editorial asks the norths masikryong ski resort where the south has offered to send budding skiers to train was built using child labor chosun ilbos editors contend that kim is astutely using the olympics stunt to get in the good graces of the international left and distract from a us led global effort to cripple his economy and force kim to abide by international law north korea they argue wants to flaunt its nuclear power and try to steal the show with a strong message that it has no intention of giving up its nukes olympics or no olympics it seems that few believe that the olympics will serve as an opportunity for north korea to change its attitude and give up its missile and nuclear programs and what is seoul doing the piece concluded evidence on north korean state propaganda networks indicates that kim is attempting to use the olympics to convince north koreans that a unified korean under the kim dynasty is imminent chosun highlights a propaganda clip called reunification is by korean nation itself sic and television coverage that does not mention that south korea is hosting the winter olympics as signs that moons grand gesture has not triggered a change in attitude in pyongyang north korea is also demanding that american assets withdraw from south korea and that seoul end its military cooperation with the country it looks as though north korea is already presenting a laundry list of demands for agreeing to take part chosun whose coverage tends to skew conservative laments follow frances martel on facebook and twitter please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

president obama secretary clinton and jeb bush remember him have declared with one voice america doesnt need border walls meanwhile around the rest of the western world walls are springing up in order to defend the sovereignty of nation states walls arent a new phenomenon as even cnn admits but the rate at which theyre springing up is certainly unprecedented at least  countries now have border walls or barriers making this one of the few times in recent history where america has been behind on an issue i say america i mean the us political establishment because we know according to new cnn polling yeah i know that at least  per cent of people are in favour of mr trumps long touted wall being built this ignores the shy builders people who wont tell pollsters they back the wall but secretly do now britain is building a wall okay its only a  metre high wall but its a concrete wall nonetheless and its aim is clear stop migrants attempting to enter the country illegally the reason is simple walls work it just depends on what your aim is if you intend to have porous or no borders then dont build a wall if your intent is to secure your country and enforce the law of the land you have to erect barriers this is why hillary clinton herself was in favour of border fences as recently as  still bragging about it in  but clearly her marching orders have changed this is the world the globalists have created with mass migration endless wars and even stupid drug policies israels wall even the left wing slate magazine was forced to admit the israeli fence is very efficient the number of fatalities from terror attacks within israel dropped from more than  in  to fewer than  in  the number of bombings fell from dozens to fewer than  the country has barriers with the west bank gaza and egypt and is now constructing a barrier with jordan hungarys wall this has been one of the most effective barriers given the speed at which it was erected in recent times when the migrant crisis was still in full swing last year hungary began closing the west balkan migrant route blocking people marching through from serbia in september and cutting the country off from unwanted incursions from croatia migrant numbers went from  illegal crossings a day to just  while some of this can be attributed to a slow down in crossing attempts this cannot explain the entirety away hungarys wall worked macedonias wall so effective is macedonias wall that migrants have been storming it en masse in an attempt to break it down these are the scenes some people want to avoid on the us mexico border and to avoid them theyd rather allow illegal crossings to continue but the number of illegal crossings dropped by  per cent after macedonia strengthened its border with greece according to figures from the european unions own border agency frontex in march of this year  people crossed the greek macedonian border illegally just  per cent of the figure for the same month last year again while some of this can be attributed to the decline in crossing attempts that decline itself was prompted by the erection of the barriers migrants stopped attempting to use the route and thus the pull factor was eradicated when they found out that walls stood in their way walls around the world kenya saudi arabia and turkey have all built walls which have scarcely been referred to as racist or xenophobic in the same way mr trump or indeed mr orban or mr netanyahus walls have been there is a double standard for walls around the world in  the border fence set to be erected between india and pakistan was lauded by the liberal new york times their headline read india and pakistan good fences make good neighbors the united nations itself  a bulwark of the globalist establishment  still enforces a  year old demilitarised zone in cyprus complete with barbed wire fencing concrete walls watchtowers and even minefields and spain in their african enclaves of ceuta and melilla have strictly enforced border barriers without which anyone could set foot on european union soil in africa and claim asylum again the policies of the globalists via the eu created a situation within which it was impossible to not have walls americas walls the idea of walls or fences to keep america safe is not new either and im not talking about the ones around hillary clintons family home in chappaqua which is surrounded by a security fence with a guardhouse though there is that in may the current chief of the us border patrol agency ronald vitiello said that barriers and walls on the us border do help stop the surging tide of illegal immigration into the united states asked during a senate subcommittee hearing if barriers worked he replied barriers as in physical barriers they have been they have been right so all of the things we use on the border physical barriers fencing as one technology is a great benefit to us plus the agencies still have to have that response as well opposition to the building of walls doesnt come from any reasonable rationale or evidence based position it comes from ideology as is evident from time magazines article entitled this is why walls dont work it is worthwhile reading if only because youll see that it was written specifically for the headline to be out there rather than making any legitimate criticisms the sum total of it if you dont have time amounts to walls make us feel safer than they actually make us th century walls werent very good and people will try and find alternative routes anyway leaving aside the first two risible arguments the latter is tantamount to saying dont lock your car door because people will just smash the window the point of border walls is not to make it impossible but rather as difficult as possible for illegal border crossings israel macedonia spain hungary and other nations around the world have proved this can work im delighted britain is following in their footsteps raheem kassam is the editor in

upon being told that president obama had publicly claimed he did not know about hillary clintons use of a private email server longtime clinton aide and counsel cheryl mills told clinton campaign chairman john podesta we need to clean this up the revelation comes in the th batch of emails released by wikileaks reportedly from john podestas email account the email chain dated march   was started by josh schwerin currently a national spokesman for the hillary clinton campaign after he saw a tweet from a reporter i have some questions here pictwittercomufkeozcxm  katherine miller katherinemiller march   that caused schwerin to email a group of people including white house director of communications jennifer palmieri and hillary clintons traveling press secretary nick merrill schwerin included the tweet and wrote jen you probably have more on this but it looks like potus just said he found out hrc was using her personal email when he saw it in the news nick merrill forwarded that email to top clinton aide cheryl mills who then forwarded it to podesta with a clear admission that she was aware president obama had exchanged emails with clinton on her private server fromcherylmillsgmailcom to johnpodestagmailcom date     subject fwd potus on hrc emails we need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say stategov tom fitton president of judicial watch the government watchdog group that has pursued the email server story and deposed cheryl mills told breitbart news exclusively this new information further highlights why clinton email scandal has always been an obama scandal that goes far beyond the secretary of states office and reaches directly into the white house the american people should also be deeply concerned the obama administrations response to the president being caught in an apparent lie almost immediately after this email shows that cheryl mills realized that president obamas statements needed cleaning up the white house response was to issue new regulations that walled off any ability to further investigate the presidents statements as us news reported  days after the mills email in an articled title most transparent white house dumps foia regulations for itself the obama administration announced tuesday it will ditch regulations that subjected large portions of white house correspondence to public records requests a decision derided by transparency advocates who wryly noted it was issued during a week celebrating open access to government the notice exempting the white houses office of administration from the requirements of the freedom of information act was contained in tuesdays federal register reversing a three decade old policy during sunshine week the annual celebration of the foia law the newly published email raises serious questions for mills podesta and president obama on october  fox news host brett baier asked hillary clintons vice presidential running mate tim kaine about obamas claim first baier played kaine the video clip of obamas statement cbs news mr president when did you first learn that hillary clinton used an e mail system outside the us government for official business while she was secretary of state barack obama president of the united states at the same time everybody else learned it through news reports cbs news did you know about hillary clintons use of private e mail server obama no cbs news while she was secretary of state obama no then baier pressed kaine about obamas statement baier at the same time senator he was using a pseudonym and an e mail address to communicate with secretary clinton and theres communication and there are e mails from staff that suggest they wanted to hold that back and were talking about what to do did the president lie there kaine well i dont know becausei actually do not know if hes communicating by e mail with hillary does he know that its a private server i mean i dont exactly know if i send somebody an e mail exactly what their setup is i dont really think about that much and i cant imagine that the president with all thats on his mind would either i do know is this that there was an extensive as you know bret investigation by the fbi under the direction of a wonderful and tough career public servant jim comey jim was in the us attorneys office in the eastern district of virginia when i was the mayor of richmond and hes somebody with the highest standards of integrity and he reached a conclusion after a very long investigation that no reasonable prosecutor would take this to the next step i think that still has not been effectively challenged i know there are people who would like to re litigate that but given the depth of that investigation and his own credibility i think his conclusion you know probably gets it right cheryl mills was given a limited immunity deal by the fbi during their investigation into the private server this story is developing

donna laframboise has a great piece in the spectator  how many scientific papers just arent true  about why so much science research these days is bunk because the whole peer review process is broken she means climate science especially of course someone should tell the guys at green propaganda site carbonbrief thousands of peer reviewed academic papers are published about climate change every year these articles form the bedrock of climate science underpinning the assessment reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and also enviro activist ed begley jr who went postal on tv in this mega rant about the vital importance of peer review and this smug simpering tosser john oliver and so on everyone on the alarmist side of the argument is forever invoking consensus and peer review because the appeal to authority is all theyve got their science is tainted beyond redemption and the only hope theyve got of persuading the world that its not is to hide the facts behind barriers of supposed expertise you little people cannot possibly be expected to understand these complex matters instead you must take on trust the expertise of the climate scientists who have written all these learned papers and the reason you can take on trust the expertise of their learned papers is that they have been carefully assessed by other climate experts in the process we call peer review  except of course as donna laframboise points out these papers often havent been vetted at all we have known for some time about the random and arbitrary nature of peer reviewing in   already published papers were assigned fictitious author and institution names before being resubmitted to the same journal  to  months later the duplication was noticed in three instances but the remaining nine papers underwent review by two referees each only one paper was deemed worthy of seeing the light of day the second time it was examined by the same journal that had already published it lack of originality wasnt among the concerns raised by the second wave of referees a significant part of the problem is that anyone can start a scholarly journal and define peer review however they wish no minimum standards apply and no enforcement mechanisms ensure that a journals publicly described policies are followed some editors admit to writing up fake reviews under cover of anonymity rather than going to the trouble of recruiting bona fide referees two years ago it emerged that  papers containing computer generated gibberish had survived the peer review process of reputable publishers there are serious knock on effects politicians and journalists have long found it convenient to regard peer reviewed research as de facto sound science saying look at the studies is a convenient way of avoiding argument but nature magazine has disclosed how over a period of  months a team of researchers attempted to correct dozens of substantial errors in nutrition and obesity research among these was the claim that the height change in a group of adults averaged nearly three inches  cm over eight weeks the team reported that editors seemed unprepared or ill equipped to investigate take action or even respond in kafkaesque fashion after months of effort culminated in acknowledgement of a gaffe journals then demanded that the team pay thousands of dollars before a letter calling attention to other peoples mistakes could be published bear this in mind next time you find yourself in an argument about climate change with an alarmist almost certainly they will attempt to pour scorn on your relative lack of scientific expertise to which you can safely and confidently reply that the authorities they are invoking as their arbiter of higher truth are very likely a bunch of charlatans and chancers also be sure to point out  as i do in my book watermelons  that neither watson and crick nor einstein were peer reviewed then finally if they still wont shut up sock them with this the climate truth file from cfact in which youll find every cod scientific fallacy about climate change debunked please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

it was a headline that launched headlines on august  politico the buzzy bible of the beltway put these words atop its homepage hillary clintons run out the clock strategy the democrat aims to ignore the email and foundation controversies seeing a shrinking calendar as her friend in other words hillary has it in the bag democrats can start measuring the drapes in the oval office as the article explained the clintonites having all but won the  election now must just ride it out that is get going on early voting and other get out the vote efforts and then sit back and count down the days until victory on november  indeed politico offered us a peek into the inner soul of the clinton presidential campaign perhaps providing too much information the article emphasized that the run out the clock strategy was reflective of the thinking of the candidate its a strategy borne in part of a belief held deeply by clinton herself that the email controversy is a fake scandal and that voters are as sick of it as the candidate herselfand by the profound weaknesses of clintons opponent so there we have it hillary thinks that all the questions and concerns are just a product of the fabled vast right wing conspiracy and if hillary doesnt want to hear any bad newsor answer any questionsits a safe bet that nobody on her campaign staff wants to tell her any bad news or urge her actually to hold a press conference and besides theres plenty of good news to talk about why she raised  million just in august she is beloved from the hamptons to the hollywood hills yet amidst all the lavish partying some observers are offering a grimmer assessment appearing like the ghost of the murdered banquo crashing macbeths celebratory feast a few days after the politico story on august  election analyst nate silver headlined his piece at fivethirtyeight its too soon for clinton to run out the clock he observed its august and the number of undecided voters is high and so the outcome remains fairly uncertain msnbcs joe scarborough then added on august  she needs to wake up and understand she could still lose indeed the polls have been tightening the latest real clear politics polling average shows the four way raceand it is a four way race the libertarian candidate gary johnson is on the ballot in all  states and the green candidate jill stein is on the ballot in at least  statesas being neck and neck clinton leads by just  percent and her overall total is a less than commanding  percent we might add that the general rule for incumbentsand hillary is certainly a quasi incumbentis that undecideds will break against the incumbent on election day still its a four way race and so we cant know for whom those late deciders will break and yet can say with almost certainty they wont break for clinton in the face of this obvious weakness other observers too are expressing skepticism heres the hill on september  clintons run out the clock strategy under fire as the piece noted the democratic nominee nearly vanished from the campaign trail in august to attend high end private fundraisers and to prepare for the first presidential debate on sept  yes clinton conspicuously did not travel to louisiana to console the flood victims back in  she reportedly made this derisive comment about white southerners to her husband screw em    you dont owe them a thing bill theyre doing nothing for you you dont have to do anything for them meanwhile the controversy about the clinton foundation and her handling of the e mail matter has exploded its now front page news even for the msm but of course hillary over consulted over handled and over protected as she is has little capacity to react besides she must prepare for that first debatea debate thats more than three weeks away and at the same time trump is everywhere after a speech on the morning of august  he jetted to mexico met with president enrique pea nieto and then returned to the us for another speech trump is a year older than hillary and yet he has vastly more energy and zeal for campaigning for its part politico deeply invested as it is in the clinton campaign continues to be a source of fawning headlines hence this keeper on september  clintons advisers tell her to prep for a landslide it was later softened to the slightly less cheerleader ish clinton advisors see multiple paths to a commanding win displaying unchecked confidence the democrats paid consultants say she has a wide open route to the white house as an aside we can observe that fawning headlines might make for nice reading at clintons brooklyn hq but misleading headlines only add to an unjustifiable complacency yet even at politico which has so much riding on a clinton victory doubts are starting to creep in this quote is from a september  story attributed to a longtime adviser to both clintons we have a ton of work to do being candid and trustworthy are the two last big hurdles for her and the debate is as much about dealing with those as disqualifying trump we might pause over some of those words being candid and trustworthy are the two last big hurdles for her and this is from an ally okay so it would seem that the  election is to put it mildly no shoo in in fact weve seen it before and when was that back in  the parallels arent exact but they are persuasive the incumbent president that year was of course harry truman today the nd president is seen as a great man but at the time truman having assumed the presidency after the death of the revered franklin d roosevelt in  was seen as something of a bumbler an unworthy successor as wags liked to say back then to err is truman moreover the democrats had enjoyed uncontested power in washington since  and the voters were itching for a change indeed the republicans had won a smashing victory in the  midterm elections their slogan was blunt had enough one of the republicans who defeated a democratic incumbent that year was a young navy veteran named richard nixon so in the run up to the  election republicans were feeling good they had a strong presidential candidate they thought in new york governor thomas e dewey in fact the polls showed dewey ahead by what many back then judged to be an invincible marginfive or six points yet for his part truman would have none of it advised by top strategist clark clifford truman calculated that the country was still basically with him and his party that is the voters were grateful to the democrats for social security for farm programs for labor unions for recognizing the embattled state of israel and for winning world war iiso they just needed a reminder at the same time truman resolved to paint the republicans as unchanged since the bad old days of herbert hoover the hated predecessor to fdr in his acceptance speech at the philadelphia democratic convention on july   truman laid it on the line i will win this election and make these republicans like itdont you forget that yes it was a brassy display of bravado from an underdog but truman wasnt anywhere near done victory has become a habit in our party it has been elected four times in succession and i am convinced it will be elected a fifth time in november the reason is that the people know that the democratic party is the peoples party the record of the democratic party is written in the accomplishments of the last  years having thrown down the gauntlet truman proceeded to lay out all that the democrats had done for farmers for workersand for the country in some ways trumans speech was counter intuitive to modern ears these days we are always told that elections are about the future not the past and thats true but its also true that past performance is the best single indicator of future performance and so for example the fact that unemployment in  was less than four percentit had been  percent the last time a republican had been in the white housewas more than meaningful to the voters in other words trumans mission as he defined it was clear cut he simply had to rally all the democratic voters it was to use the modern parlance a base electionand back then the democrats had the bigger base the message was simple dont go back to the bad old days still the experts and pundits were convinced that truman would lose in october newsweek surveyed political savants in each of the  states and they were unanimous dewey would win meanwhile the pollstersthere were only three back then gallup roper and crossleywere equally sure that dewey was the inevitable victor in fact they all stopped their surveying weeks before the november  election yet as we all know truman won the  election indeed he won it by a comfortable  percent marginand with an edge of  votes in the electoral college so what had happened as we have seen the fundamentals favored truman this was a new deal country in  and truman was a loyal and faithful new dealerand he had of course been fdrs vice president on the republican side dewey understood this reality thats why he tried to be moderate and uncontroversial during the campaign he didnt want to be thought of as the voice of the republican party he wanted just to be tom the nice guy sporting a stylist mustache to borrow a phrase he hoped he could just run out the clock yet truman in all his feisty aggressiveness pulled back deweys bland and opaque veil folks dont be fooled in his heart hes just another hooverite okay so now back to the present whats the parallel how does the  election speak to the  election heres how this time clinton as we have seen is the quasi incumbent but this time people are anything but happy with the status quo thus the difference in  the fundamentals were with truman in  the fundamentals are against hillary whereas all truman had to do  years ago was remind people that theyd never had it so good this year clinton cant rest on such laurels of accomplishmentbecause there arent any and so she hasnt even tried nor does she talk much about the future instead she just attacks trump as we all know that attack trump strategy was working well for awhile combined of course with some trump mistakes yet in recent weeks trump has found his footing indeed its now trump whos on the offensive he declares that the economy is slow that crime and terrorism are rising that the border is in chaos that the iran deal is a disaster and who can truly say hes wrong in the face of these armor piercing attacks hillary even with the msm rallying to her defense can say little in response yes they can jointly accuse trump of being dark and dystopic but thats about all they can say soon such bleatswhich bespeak more than a little bicoastal smugnessbegin to sound tinny the mere yelping of elite insiders in fact the bottom line today is that most people are feeling dark and dystopicand with good reason as the atlantic noted the other day a majority of americans now worry that they or their families will be victims of terrorism up from a third less than two years ago according to a survey by the public religion research institute nearly two thirds worry about being victims of violent crime another poll by gallup found that concern about crime and violence is at its highest level in  years thus we can see the key question is how the voters assess the state of the nation in  they were happy with the status quo and so they voted to keep it in  they are unhappy with the status quo and so it seems increasingly likely that they will vote to change it thus if we look ahead we can say donald meet your spiritual predecessor harry and hillary meet your predecessor tom comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook

a series of public spats between fox news personalities has revealed the extent to which the coverage and handling of republican frontrunner donald trump has created an atmosphere of bitterness and back biting at the cable news network the networks relationship with trump has been strained ever since primetime host megyn kelly launched an opening salvo at the new york billionaire during the fox news republican primary debate last august which provoked a counter offensive from the candidate that grew into a protracted feud with the network at large in an interview with charlie rose last week kelly renewed her sentiments that her colleague bill oreilly should have done more to defend her in his interview with trump when the gop candidate continued disparaging her kelly first aired this criticism in an interview with more magazine last month saying i do wish that oreilly had defended me more in his interview with trump i would have defended him more but disagreements about the handling of trump at fox isnt confined to just kelly and oreilly on sunday night the five co host greg gutfeld took aim at his colleagues greta van susteren and sean hannity mocking them for their perceived kid glove treatment of trump gutfeld took to twitter to ridicule van susterens sunday night town hall with the gop frontrunner whew another rough one for trump how does he put up with this stuff  greggutfeld greggutfeld april   according to my score donald trump won tonights debate by an overwhelming margin i scored it  to   greggutfeld greggutfeld april   i have been informed tonight wasn t an actual debate but nonetheless the other candidates clearly were too scared to show up  greggutfeld greggutfeld april   gutfeld then took aim at hannity and get this tomorrow trump s gunna be on hannity so u know donald will be facing the fight of his life thoughts and prayers  greggutfeld greggutfeld april   during the five last week gutfeld publicly acknowledged the in fighting and tension within fox news between pro and anti trump camps saying we as a show are facing internal strife from a micro level to a macro level look at the five on any given day we have tension over this nomination over this candidate you can look at our network as a whole the incident between former breitbart reporter michelle fields and trump campaign manager corey lewandowski has also sparked a public twitter spat between hannity and fields who once appeared regularly on the fox business network show cashin in after hannitys interview with trump monday night fields blasted him on twitter for not challenging trumps criticism of her battery charge against lewandowski this whole situation is insane so sad to see my friend seanhannity not challenge trump on his lies httpstcokltxbjiqg  michelle fields michellefields april   seanhannity you re not even going to challenge realdonaldtrump when he so obviously lies and says i grabbed him  michelle fields michellefields april   hannity replied to fields ok michellefields i wrote u privately i watched the tape  times i do not see what u allege sorry i don t httpstcomlvgeqrzsx  sean hannity seanhannity april   fields replied back acknowledging the private correspondence between them seanhannity yes u wrote me privately  then brought it up on radio  tv last week that you wrote me privately what s your point  michelle fields michellefields april   finally fields tweeted alright seanhannity ignore all the evidence congrats i m sure this will earn you another town hall with trump  michelle fields michellefields april   the fields incident in particular has exposed some of the tensions at fox with the anti trump faction led by kelly who last january dedicated an entire show to national reviews against trump issue featuring sympathetic coverage of fields battery allegation while the more pro trump factions like hannity and van susteren have expressed skepticism on his radio show hannity said the battery charges were insane and that peoples perceptions of the fields lewandowski incident are based on who they support for the nomination nicknaming the incident grab gate van susteren took issue with the fact that it was being classified as a crime on her show last week she said now whatever happened in the scrum and i dont think the video or eyewitness statement is convincing this incident never should have ended up as a crime it should have ended with an apology fox news sunday host chris wallace also weighed in on the issue in an interview with the gop frontrunner last week wallace agreed with trumps assertion that fields exaggerated the incident i think she completely misrepresented it early on i do wallace said on the five co host dana perino who along with gutfeld form the shows anti trump faction seemed to have a tense exchange with their pro trump co host eric bolling when gutfeld make a joke about lewandowski grabbing someone and bolling rejoined with did she fall down in reference to what he perceived as fields exaggerated claim perino tersely replied she never said she almost fell perino might have had a similarly tense exchange behind the scenes with hannity oliver darcy from theblaze tweeted hannity says on air that danaperino erased the twitter app from his phone shes mad because  i unload  perino replied as a friend said it was a st century intervention he wont miss it in a follow up tweet perino seemed to brush off any suggestion that this interaction was particularly contentious he let me delete it  i didn t even have to push httpstcoqmkzohhwv  dana perino danaperino april   there is no indication these tensions among fox personalities will be relieved any time soon they perhaps extend all the way to the top in his recent profile of the trump campaign in new york magazine gabe sherman alleged that trump was able to do something that no other republican has done before take on fox news because he has compromising information on fox news chairman roger ailes from a former employee sherman wrote an odd bit of coincidence had given trump a card to play against fox founder roger ailes in  i published a biography of ailes which upset the famously paranoid executive several months before it landed in stores ailes fired his longtime pr adviser brian lewis accusing him of being a source during lewiss severance negotiations lewis hired judd burstein a powerhouse litigator and claimed he had bombs that would destroy ailes and fox news thats when trump got involved when roger was having problems he didnt call  people he called me trump said burstein it turned out had worked for trump briefly in the s and ailes asked trump to mediate trump ran the negotiations out of his office at trump tower roger had lawyers very expensive lawyers and they couldnt do anything i solved the problem fox paid lewis millions to go away quietly and trump im told learned everything lewis had planned to leak if ailes ever truly went to war against trump trump would have the arsenal to launch a retaliatory strike how this drama will play out at a news network that has increasingly made itself the story this election cycle is anyones guess whatever the outcome the network can certainly agree with trump on one point hes good for ratings follow rebecca mansour on twitter ramansour comment count on this article reflects comments made

representative carolyn b maloney d ny  has introduced a bill requiring all traditional handguns to be retrofitted with smart gun technology before they can be sold the bill grants  years until the retrofitting requirement goes into effect according to a press release from maloneys office the smart gun legislation is called the handgun trigger safety act it would be implemented in stagesrequiring manufacturers to make only smart guns within the next five years and then require the retrofitting of traditional handguns five years later the act would also use taxpayer money to develop and improve personalized handgun technology to increase efficacy and decrease costs and would provide reimbursement to manufacturers for the costs of retrofitting handguns the reimbursement would come out of the department of justice assets forfeiture fund maloney said how many more kids have to die how many more police officers have to be killed with their own weapon before we come to our senses we wouldnt drive in cars or use baby cribs that didnt adopt the latest safety technology and we shouldnt use guns that dont take advantage of this technology either im proud to reintroduce the handgun trigger safety act to support the development and adoption of innovative safety technology for handguns we should be taking advantage of new technology not shunning it two very important points need to be made first smart guns are not smart anyone who has a phone with an fingerprint reader can see for themselves by dipping their thumb into a glass of tea then swiping that wet thumb across the reader the phone does not unlock in fact wetting a thumb or finger with almost any liquid makes the fingerprint unreadable and for those of you who live in cold or cool climates trying swiping your phones fingerprint reader while you are wearing gloves some may recoil at the ignorance of that suggestion but if you were carrying a smart gun and came under attack on a day on which you wore gloves you would have to swipe that reader with a gloved finger in hopes of defending yourself and these are simply the problems with smart guns that have biometric readers smart guns that activate from being in close proximity to a radio paired bracelet or watch present an entirely new set of problems the second important point that needs to be made is that guns are by no means the greatest danger for accidental death that children face in truth children are many times more likely to die from fire or water than from firearms centers for disease control and prevention figures from  showed that children under ten were seven times more likely to accidentally burn to death and  times more likely to accidentally drown than to be killed in an accidental firearm related death crime prevention research centers john lott highlighted the far greater danger of fire and water by showing that  children under the age of ten were killed in firearm related accidents in  versus  who died in unintentional fireburn deaths and  who died in unintentional drowning incidents yet maloney is pushing smart guns instead of smart matches and smart pools awr hawkins is the second amendment columnist for breitbart news and host of bullets with awr hawkins a breitbart news podcast he is also the political analyst for armed american radio follow him on twitter awrhawkins reach him directly at awrhawkinsbreitbartcom please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

president donald trumps legislative affairs director does not try to push senate democrats to support trumps pro american immigration reform promises and policies according to an amnesty boosting article in politico marc shorts neutral stance towards trumps main campaign promise is described and praised in the article by pro amnesty reporters matthew nussbaum and seung min kim in his first year as trumps top liaison to congress republicans say short has been more of a facilitator rather than an arm twister that role will become particularly critical on immigration  an issue congress has spectacularly failed to resolve in the past i dont see him as the real deal maker so much as the kind of go between the mediator said sen shelley moore capito r wva whos interacted with short on a host of issues including health care the opioid crisis and energy policy he doesnt try to reshape our thoughts he sort of takes it in and then im assuming reports back to the white house shorts neutral stance shields him from the venom aimed by democrats and the media at the trump and his aides as they try to implement trumps  campaign promises in immigration short has enjoyed a relatively smooth relationship with capitol hill compared to some of his white house colleagues both chief of staff john kelly and policy adviser stephen miller have already clashed with both democrats and moderate republicans over immigration leaving short to broker a truce shorts neutrality likely will have an impact on trumps success during this coming weeks debate on the nations economic policy of growth by immigration a loose coalition of democrats and business first republicans are hoping to use the debate to bury trumps  campaign promise and his four part amnesty and immigration framework shorts neutrality also gets praise from gop amnesty advocates who are trying hard to defeat trumps four part amnesty and immigration framework according to politico my impression of him is that hes just a very grounded guy moves through his work focuses on the priorities and just does his job sen lisa murkowski r alaska said so he doesnt seem to be impacted by distraction hes very purposeful its been good nothing but good murkowski is pushing for an amnesty to bring more workers to alaska employers before the liaison job short worked as a never trump organizer for the pro amnesty koch brothers short got the capitol hill liaison job because of recommendations by vice president mike pence but pence is also a cheap labor advocate in  he wrote an article for the wall street journal backing legislation that would let employers perpetually import an unlimited number of cheap and temporary foreign workers to replace white collar and blue collar americans if pences policy had been enacted americans would not be getting wage raises because the expanding economy has almost run out of workers and trump would not be getting the political benefits of rising wages short did not adopt a neutral policy during the push for tax cuts which was supported by the business groups and the koch brothers in september  for example he said a tax cut is essential to us  right now he also appeared on tv repeatedly to push democrats to back trumps tax bill at this point sausage making is never fun but all senators are trying to get to yes on the republican side  were disappointed we dont have democrat members looking to provide tax relief and corporate relief thats our biggest obstacle politicos reporters declined to describe shorts long ties to the anti trump cheap labor groups instead they commend short for his neutral mediator role even as the presidents primary campaign promise come under intense attacks from an alliance of democrats establishment reporters and business first republicans including the koch brothers kim who has taken a job with the washington post and nussbaum describe short as neutral between trumps priorities and his rivals pro amnesty push short now finds himself trying to navigate his next big challenge balancing his tempestuous bosss demands on an unpopular immigration plan with stubborn lawmakers who are struggling to devise their own deal on so called dreamers particularly in the senate many lawmakers are adamant that the white houses wishes on an immigration deal arent going to dictate whatever deal the senators end up crafting during the floor fight next week in fact trumps wishes reflect the extraordinary wave of pro american populism in the november  presidential election which swept him into the white house  and which also swept progressives out of the white house also many polls show that trumps immigration policies are very popular among americans because they help raise wages amid complaints from ceos  and some democratic senators to help keep white collar and blue collar wages low business groups democrats and the establishment media tout misleading industry funded nation of immigrants polls which pressure americans to say they welcome migrants including the roughly  million dreamer illegals the alternative priority or fairness polls  plus the  election  show that voters in the polling booth put a much higher priority on helping their families neighbors and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a high tech high immigration low wage economy the voters preference for economic policies that favor americans over would be immigrants explains why trumps  immigration policies are very popular including among blue collar african americans who are a core element of the democrats current electoral base four million americans turn  each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market but the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly  million new legal immigrants by providing work permits to roughly  million resident foreigners and by doing little to block the employment of roughly  million illegal immigrants comment count on this article

on tuesdays broadcast of fox news channels fox  friends supreme court associate justice neil gorsuch stressed the importance of the us constitutions separation of powers co host ainsley earhardt asked let me start with the separation of powers when there is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch what is the role of the judicial branch gorsuch said well one thing i wanted to talk about in the book and i think writing about it and talking about it for years is the importance of the separation of powers and how it keeps us free and when it comes to the role of the judiciary i believe that the role is to be faithful to the original meaning of the constitution when asked about james madison gorsuch said well i think one thing he might tell us is to pay attention to the separation of powers madison originally thought we didnt need a bill of rights he wrote the bill of rights but he thought what would really keep us free is the separation of powers and if you look around the world today i think he has a point every country in the world has a great bill of rights these days my personal favorite is north koreas yes north korea it promises everything we have the right to free speech a right to privacy and my personal favorite especially this time of the year the rights to relaxation but the fact of the matter is that those rights arent worth the ink on the page and theyre not because all powers accumulated in one mans hands he added what madison knew is that people arent angels and that we need to separate powers to keep us free i worry today when i read that only about a third of americans can name the three branches of government and  of americans apparently believe that judith sheindlin serves on the united states supreme court you know her as judge judy i love judge judy but shes not one of my colleagues he concluded the truth is that our rights including the separation of powers are only as good as the people who want to keep them there daniel webster said that it took  years for a self governing people to arrange our constitution and it really was a miracle those things arent kept by accident and theres no guarantee they will endure unless people care about them follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

los angeles  rep tulsi gabbard d hi told breitbart news on sunday evening that the democratic national committee dnc rules for qualifying for the presidential primary debates were arbitrary and lacked transparency breitbart news let me ask you this tulsi you are one of the candidates that was left off the debate stage but during the period when candidates were qualifying you were with your us army national guard training do you think it was disrespectful of the dnc to the military not to make some special allowance for that gabbard i think the big issue here is bigger than one about me its about transparency in the process and the lack of it because unless there is transparency in this whole process then voters lose trust that the process is actually working for them so this is the change that im calling for from the dnc is to bring about transparency and some explanations and some answers about the very arbitrary decisions that they have made and how thats impacting voters having a real choice in this election breitbart news but do you think they should have made some allowance for that  that you were serving your country gabbard im not going to dwell on the past i think its important again we look forward and see how we can continue to make things better transparency accountability and always remembering who is at the heart of our democracy and our elections its the people weve got to make sure that they have faith that the elections are working for them gabbard did not qualify for the september debate despite having enough individual donors more than  because she did not meet the polling requirement please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

a group of leading populist thinkers met in milan thursday to discuss the future of europe and especially the relationship between the european union eu and its individual member states a growing malaise has been sweeping europe as citizens grow progressively more distrustful of the european union and desirous of recovering the sovereignty of their own nations and of taking back responsibility for their own destinies the milan conference titled sovereignty vs globalism shifting geopolitical realities in europe and the usa analyzed this phenomenon by comparing the populist nationalist fervor in europe with the movements that produced the trump revolution in the united states and brexit in the united kingdom the meeting was cosponsored by the milan based political cultural journal logos together with breitbart news ted malloch donald trumps putative ambassador to the european union spoke of the presidents first  days in office laying out the statistics of his numerous accomplishments that are rarely if ever discussed by the mainstream media and comparing them to past administrations he also drew comparisons with europes recent history as eu power in brussels has grown steadily while many member states languish in economic stagnation and migratory crises the migration question came up again as prof giuseppe valditara the academic director of logos explored europes contemporary migrant crisis with similar events in the ancient roman empire that eventually led to its collapse many speak of the need for generosity in welcoming huge numbers of economic migrants valditara noted but few speak of the generosity needed toward our children and future generations as we hand on to them a society that scarcely resembles the one we received in heritage a comment that elicited enthusiastic applause from the audience that filled the hall italys former finance minister senator giulio tremonti spoke of the anger experienced by those who thought that they had finally figured out how to create the new man and the new society based on a unitary thought allowing no opposition only to find their project thwarted by the very democratic system they claimed to be serving tremonti the author of numerous books including his recently published mundus furiosus offered a historical analysis of how the european union has gradually separated itself from an active partnership with the individual member states arrogating more and more decision making power to itself brussels tremonti argued has become less and less democratic with the passage of years fearful of subjecting its authority to the will of the people it governs the europe of brussels has little by little taken on the absurd form of an upside down pyramid tremonti contended built with para constitutional measures of an excess of power and a deficit of democracy dr thomas williams breitbarts rome bureau chief and co organizer of the conference spoke of the need for greater subsidiarity in the relationship between the eu and its members understood as the concentration of decision making power as close as possible to the citizens who are affected by it the trump revolution in the united states williams argued was the direct result of peoples instinctive longing to have a greater say in setting the conditions under which they live work and raise their children and thus was an unspoken appeal to the principle of subsidiarity against hyper regulation government overreach and fiercely enforced political correctness in the united states williams noted people reasserted their own sovereignty and right to self governmenta phenomenon mirrored by growing populist movements in europe marcello foa editor in chief of the swiss based corriere del ticino spoke of the ideological battle being waged between the establishment bent on holding onto its power and the status quo and the unsatisfied masses who are tired of being told what they are to think and what is best for them and would like the chance to decide for themselves the establishment would like to brand all uncomfortable ideas as fake news foa noted when in reality they simply represent an alternative perspective and worldview a comment that drew spontaneous applause from the audience while many are aware only of the passive acquiescence of contemporary european society to its various ailments the milan conference showed that an energetic and forward thinking nucleus of thinkers is busy planning how to get it back on its feet again the way to make europe great again the speakers seemed to agree is by restoring the greatness of the individual nations and cultures that she comprises please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

peter alexander nbcs white house correspondent invited president donald trump on friday to apologize for allegedly disparaging fallen military personnel the unsubstantiated allegations  which included no evidence  were published by the atlantic on thursday the atlantic alleged that trump derided americans who died in wars as losers citing unidentified people with firsthand knowledge of a discussion with the president in  alexander asked for trumps apology while wearing a mask his twitter profile photo also shows him wearing a surgical mask he reiterated atlantic writer jeffrey goldbergs allegations new when my son volunteered and joined the united states military and went to iraq for a year won the bronze star and other commendations he was not a sucker joe biden angrily responds to allegations in theatlantic that trump disparaged fallen servicemembers  peter alexander peteralexander september   new from theatlantic trump skipped a visit to an american military cemetery in france after calling the dead losers for getting killed full story here httpstcopugrrtcs  jeffrey goldberg jeffreygoldberg september   partial transcript below alexander sir do you need to apologize to military servicemembers and veterans trump no its a fake story written by a magazine that is probably not going to be around much longer but it was a totally fake story and that was confirmed by many people who were actually there it was a terrible thing that somebody could say the kind of things and especially to me because ive done more for the military than almost anybody else you look at how the va is doing its doing incredibly well we got all sorts of things done from accountability to veterans choice  and its got right now the highest approval rating that its ever had  percent approval rating its never been anywhere close to that nobodys done what ive done and that includes salary increases but it really includes a rebuilding of our military because as you know when i came here our military was totally depleted and we spent almost  trillion dollars trump described the atlantics claims as a fake story he added its a disgrace that theyre allowed to do that trump concluded theres nobody that considers the military  and especially people that have given their lives in the military  to me theyre heroes theyre heroes its even hard to believe how they could do it the level of bravery and to me they are absolute heroes moments later alexander joined msnbc for a live segment in which he framed the allegations as credible alexander said obviously the reason the atlantic story resonates  even as the president dismisses it  is because weve heard publicly from the president as he spoke about john mccain in  that he said mccain was only a war hero because he was captured and he likes those who were not captured so it really does raise questions about the presidents view of service and sacrifice the allegations were discredited and denied by on the record sources who were present for the discussion in which trump is alleged to have denigrated fallen troops nbc news markets itself as a politically objective and non partisan news media outlet please let us know if you re having issues with commenting
as donald trump prepares for an epic battle with first enabler hillary clinton the media is too focused on party unity and are oblivious to the fact that denunciation of trump by failed elites like the bushs as well as the prevarications of paul ryan only fuel his rise as did the opposition of mexicos ex president the chinese communists the pope david cameron the saudis and mitt romney the political class is discredited with voters hungry for change what they are missing are the millions of new voters and donors trump has brought to the party with the gop contest drawing two million more voters than the rather boring hillary v bernie bout it is important to note that in  a change in just  votes in five states would have changed the outcome of the election analytics show there are  million unregistered trump supporters in colorado iowa florida michigan nevada new jersey ohio virginia wisconsin and pennsylvania trump will have the resources to sign them up this is where elections are won all successful republican presidents  lincoln teddy roosevelt eisenhower nixon and reagan  remade the party in their image trump is snatching the party back from wall street and the special interests his is street populism far right on some issues but far left on others not a pure conservative by any means he is the best choice for conservatives on the big four issues  the economy terrorism trade and immigration those who worry about his views on eminent domain must realize that there will be no private property rights if we are incinerated by islamic radicals i met trump and we became friends when he supported ronald reagan i recognized that donald as he told me to call him in  had the charisma courage and toughness to be a strong contender and a transformative president as early as  when we went to the portsmouth nh chamber of commerce for a speech in his big black helicopter donald staked out tough policies on trade china and nato even then i was the chairman of his exploratory committee when he looked at the reform party nomination in  when we were both unimpressed with bush and gore i wanted him to run in  because i knew mitt romney was a choker  is however his time his rise is a repudiation of the polices of bush clinton bush obama that have infected both parties for  years their fiscal trade immigration and foreign policies have been in decline the rise of trump is historic and the situation unprecedented little did i know that trump would change the game and make us rethink everything we know about politics trump mounted the summit without aid of polling focus groups a policy shop analytics targeting or speech writers yet he attracted over  million votes more than any gop contender in history trump is an unabashed nationalist who wants america to be richer more successful and well smarter the rise of trump is a repudiation of the two party duopoly that has driven our country into a ditch more than ever voters know the essentially unchanged policies of bush clinton bush obama have failed trump is no neocon and unlike hillary wasnt a cheerleader for the iraq war voter anger with our decline and the destruction of jobs and economic opportunity while pursuing an expensive interventionist but incoherent foreign policy has fueled trumps rise the party need to recognize the millions of new people trump has brought to the republican process far more than anemic turnout in the lingering democratic contest this will more than offset those bailing out on trump like the departing bushs    and jeb  who feel trump rustled the horse that was theirs in fact rejection by the bushs gains trump votes george w bush and his cronies made millions on their policies while we squandered blood and treasure abroad and bailed out wall street swindlers while the economy crashed to win trump will have to deconstruct hillary in his own inimitable way without regard to political correctness threatening bills alleged sexual assault victims and ex girlfriends the iraq war the nexus of corruption between the clinton state department and the clinton foundation in which the latter became the vehicle for the facilitation of multi  million dollar bribes are all key vulnerabilities in fact the clintons voracious greed for money and their willingness to do anything for it and their hypocrisy will be their downfall trump is a fearless brawler who will go hillary clinton anywhere refusing to answer him sounds like a strategy that did not work out too well for mike dukakis comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

taiwanese president tsai ing wen gave an address for national day  essentially taiwans version of the fourth of july  on wednesday unsparingly critical of china without being overtly confrontational the key element of the speech was an appeal to the free world for protection from chinas increasingly predatorial approach to the island tsais speech was entitled democratic taiwan lights up the world she urged her audience to consider the recent dramatic changes in the international political and economic situation which she saw as defined by chinese aggression met by pushback from the united states and its asian allies the us china trade dispute has led to a restructuring of the global industrial division of labor with repercussions for the existing economic and trade order accordingly indo pacific region dynamics and cross strait relations have also become more complex the international community is concerned about chinas attempts to challenge the regional status quo as taiwan is on the frontline of the western pacific we are naturally subject to tremendous pressure for some time now chinas unilateral diplomatic offensive and military coercion have not only harmed cross strait relations they have also seriously challenged the status quo of peace and stability in the taiwan strait tsai explicitly rejected taking a confrontational stance against china but also dismissed advice that taiwan should give in and compromise instead she asked the world to send a message to china that taiwan is here to stay and interested only in stability and peaceful prosperous trade as the entire world is dealing with the expansion of chinese influence the government that i am leading will show the world taiwans strength and resilience the best way to defend taiwan is to make it indispensable and irreplaceable to the world the people of taiwan will never accept any attempt by external forces to unilaterally change the cross strait status quo and the international community will never approve of and support the violation of universal values so once again i am calling on the authorities in beijing as a responsible major power to play a positive role in the region and the world instead of being a source of conflict tsais appeal directly contradicts chinas strategy of methodically picking off taiwans allies to isolate the island an approach that has been distressingly successful since tsai took office china has worked to convince younger taiwanese that autonomy is more trouble than it is worth while demonstrating its growing military prowess and signaling the amount of independence talk beijing is willing to tolerate without violent action is diminishing the taiwanese president listed diplomatic pressure social infiltration and economic security as key elements of the threat to her country tsai is trying to flip the script by showing beijing that taiwan is valuable to the free world and crushing it would not be worth the high price china would pay we will continue to make taiwan stronger and irreplaceable in the global community this is taiwans niche for sustainable survival she said in facing changing international circumstances our strategic choice is clear and that is to staunchly defend freedom democracy and the market economy these fundamental values have been important foundations in helping taiwan become a model of asian democracy and develop a strong economy she declared tsai expressed her appreciation to the us congress for passing many taiwan friendly legislative bills and spoke highly of vice president mike pences condemnation of chinese tactics in a recent speech that infuriated beijing the wall street journal noted on wednesday that taiwanese media picked up on this portion of tsais address to compare her speech to pences remarks which have in turn been compared to the iron curtain speech sir winston churchill delivered at the dawn of the cold war as for chinas reaction state run media has largely avoided covering it aside from posting a few unflattering photos of tsai on social media according to the wall street journal the chinese government offered no official response to the speech tsais thoughts on preventing foreign powers from infiltrating and subverting our society dovetailed with accusations of election meddling leveled at china by the trump white house we are determined to defend the values of taiwans diverse democracy but if another country takes advantage of our societys freedom to infiltrate society and create chaos we absolutely will not sit by idly and will take any and all preventive measures necessary whether it be disseminating disinformation illegally obtaining scientific and technical intelligence maliciously damaging the information security system intervening in the election process or interfering with government operations if there is irrefutable evidence of crime the perpetrators will suffer serious consequences after laying out plans to improve taiwans infrastructure increase its military power and create a more stable environment for commerce tsai concluded by saluting the keepers of taiwans  lighthouses and portraying the entire nation as a lighthouse standing against the dark sea of oppression surrounding it taiwan itself is a beacon our democratic transition once illuminated our own path through the darkness and remains a beacon in the night for those who long for democracy so to all of our friends who are pursuing democracy in hong kong in mainland china and around the world you can always look to taiwan because taiwans democracy lights up the world when the world really sees the beauty of taiwan taiwan will never be alone i want to tell all of our international friends that we have the courage to persevere on our path much like the united states taiwan is preparing for local elections in november that will set the stage for the  presidential contest observers say it will be the largest and perhaps most important midterm election taiwan has ever held with some  officials on the ballot china is putting a lot of pressure on taiwanese to make them see tsais election as a grave mistake and her ouster as the key to restoring peaceable relations tsais democratic progressive party is seen as slipping against the rival kuomintang party although the dpp still holds a commanding position and not all of its critics are comfortable with kmt
sign up for our newsletter attorney general jeff sessions has been pummeled in the media for days for what journalists and democrats are calling his insult to hawaii in response to a temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge against president donald trumps executive order suspending immigration from terror prone countries but sessions was right on immigration issues hawaii is an island in many ways with different challenges than the rest of the united states sessionss full comment as relayed to relayed to mark levin was i really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the united states from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power critics have pounced on that as an attack on the separation of powers in fact it was the opposite a defense of a clearly defined executive power from overreach by an activist liberal judiciary but hawaii really is an island archipelago  first in the obvious sense that it is surrounded on every side for thousands of miles by water that makes illegal border crossings almost impossible in that sense hawaii border security as most americans understand it has nothing to do with hawaii there are a small amount of undocumented immigrants in hawaii  most from the philippines and japan and who presumably enter and then overstay their visas that is a crucial demographic difference that makes immigration issues very different for hawaii there is also a large native hawaiian population that wants little to do with the mainland some want to create an indigenous government and judicially hawaii is the left wing of the left wing ninth circuit  which is why activists brought their case there interestingly hawaiians seem to regard homeless squatters from the mainland the way some americans see illegal immigrants the hawaiian legislature perennially debates proposals to pay the homeless to leave the state permanently hawaii faces the same threat from the six designated terror prone countries as any other us point of entry in that sense a federal judge in hawaii is as competent to rule on president trumps executive order as any other however a judge in hawaii might not interpret the immigration issue the same way as one in the continental us the ruling that judge derrick watson an appointee of president barack obama delivered was based on speculation about the motives of the president when he issued the order rather than his statutory and constitutional authority to do so regardless sessionss point was that federal judges in general should defer to the president in matters of national security and immigration policy  particularly in jurisdictions that may have a peculiar lens through which they view the issue there ought to be nothing controversial about saying so democrats are choosing outrage over logic and the law comment count on this article reflects comments made on breitbartcom and facebook visit breitbart s facebook page

the tiny christian minority in jolo philippines  a majority muslim area in an overwhelmingly catholic nation  has seen renewed energy in its churches now that its faith has been tested by fire monsignor romeo s saniel vicar administrator of the vicariate of jolo told breitbart news in an interview on tuesday jolos our lady of mount carmel cathedral was partially destroyed on january  when jihadists later identified as a couple from indonesia detonated suicide bombs minutes apart inside killing  people and wounding  it was the latest in years of violent attacks saniel had witnessed or experienced while caring for the christians of jolo  including a failed assassination attempt he survived because the gun touching his head jammed when the assailant pulled the trigger saniel told breitbart news he is now endeavoring to help rebuild the cathedral and bring spiritual and economic support to the survivors of the attack the catholic church is also working to help improve educational and economic opportunities for all residents of jolo holding on to the belief that economic desperation can attract young muslims to jihadist ideology saniel spoke with breitbart news in anticipation of several events to bring awareness to the dangers facing philippine christians in muslims territories and other christians who live as minorities in the united states this week the first listening to survivors of religious persecution the call for religious freedom will take place wednesday at the united nations hosted by aid to the church in need a papal charity of the catholic church that supports persecuted christians globally aid to the church in need will also host a night of witness event  to pray reflect and listen to the victims of christian persecution  at the basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate conception in washington dc on saturday saniel highlighted the resilience of the christian faith in jolo  located in an autonomous muslim region where he says catholics amount to about three percent of the population  even in the face of bombs going off during mass the bombing and the persecution sometimes  can create a lot of blessings in disguise in our lives he said the number one blessing is we have been persecuted in this community but really remained steadfast in our faith i believe the faith of our minority christians has been tested by fire and we have a deeper commitment to the life of the church and the life of following jesus today some are exposed to so much danger but they dont walk away and they still witness the christian faith that they have he added young christians he noted have particularly experienced renewed enthusiasm in their faith there are so many young people now who are in the church in spite of the fact that they are victims of the bombing but they are back in the church and they make it so alive and i really appreciate the energy of the young people he said saniel noted that those who attacked the cathedral were foreigners and that for decades the vast majority of philippine muslims accepted the existence of christians among them most of the southern island of mindanao where jolo is located is predominantly christian nationally catholics make up  percent of the population but the bangsamoro autonomous region of muslim mindanao is an exception a nation within a nation in which the rules of living as a christian in the philippines elsewhere do not apply in jolo  we are only four percent three percent christians  percent are muslims in our area so we are a small minority and we feel that we have been persecuted because of our faith saniel told breitbart news but the majority of the muslims in our area are friendly and very open to dialogue and witnessing of our religion except a small minority now we call the wahhabists or the violent extremists they are threatening us and attacking us and our churches wahhabism is a fundamentalist strain of sunni islam originating in saudi arabia and disseminated widely through radical clerics and terrorist groups like al qaeda and the islamic state the islamic states affiliate in the philippines abu sayyaf took responsibility for the january cathedral bombing abu sayyafs largest temporary victory was the siege of marawi the largest muslim city in the country in may  president rodrigo duterte announced the death of the head of abu sayyaf isnilon hapilon in marawi in september effectively ending the siege we have the influence of the foreign wahhabists when they attacked marawi city  of the remnants now are in jolo saniel noted according to intelligence some of them are westerners  the suicide bombers who attacked our cathedral were identified as indonesians mindanao has for decades struggled against higher poverty levels than the wealthier islands to the north and hosted a muslim insurgency for decades organized by the moro islamic liberation front milf the milf who prioritized self governance joined with duterte to fight abu sayyaf and foreign jihadis its leaders warning of a coming wave of jihadists from the collapsing islamic state of iraq and syria in  while milf fighters may have come to peace under duterte years of conflict between muslim separatists and the government has made much of mindanao dangerous to christians for decades saniel noted that as a newly assigned priest in the region he survived an assassination attempt by sheer luck  or the grace of god when i was distributing holy communion to the christians of jolo two young boys were walking behind me and i felt the  caliber muzzle in the back of my head and i heard click but the gun jammed so i was saved he said i think the lord is the reason why i was saved from the attempt since then i have been working for interreligious dialogue establishing good relations with our muslim brothers and sisters and giving a platform to also prevent the recruitment of these violent extremists in our area saniel said that since the bombing many muslims living around the cathedral are more compassionate and merciful to us and they are extending help they are expressing their desire to help us in whatever way they can he also credited president duterte with helping the christian minority there and offering extensive security to prevent another bombing duterte has received criticism from international aid groups for feuding with the nations catholic leadership who have in turn condemned his violent anti drug policies in the country duterte has countered with police evidence that drug trafficking has enriched and empowered jihadis to attack christian communities he has more often dismissed catholic leaders and encouraged people to kill them saniels experience offers an alternative to the international headlines on the bombastic duterte since the bombing of the cathedral our president has been very friendly to us saniel said he has visited the church many times he has given us assistance through the military also he has visited the place many times i feel he treats us differently from the people of manila because we are minority christians and we are victimized and so our president has a softer heart and is helping rebuild our churches and the lives of christians and making sure we are also secure through the military saniel added duterte is the first president in philippine history from mindanao for saniel the priority in the aftermath of the bombing is the security of his christian congregation he says that among the policies the church will use to promote peace will be the development of social economic projects and closer ties with local muslims to better empower them to reject foreign jihadis the programs include as their goals helping the muslims become better muslims establishing schools cooperatives livelihood programs and we also take care of our small minority christians so we have a strong bond with the majority of muslims who are moderate and most of them are in government and in governance and they are graduates of our catholic schools he said please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

house speaker paul ryans immigration policy is not in the best interest of america says alabama rep mo brooks lawmakers are set to hold leadership elections this coming tuesday yet in an exclusive interview with breitbart news brooks indicated that he is not sure whether he will support the re election of speaker ryan who has a two decade long history of championing open borders immigration policies it depends on the president elects preferences brooks tells breitbart in  brooks voted to elect ryan as speaker of the house after ryan personally promised him that he would not bring up any major immigration legislation while president barack obama was still in office yet ryan swiftly broke that promise by quadrupling the controversial h b guest worker program in his omnibus spending bill which immigration attorney ian smith explained would disproportionately hurt americas most vulnerable workers by allowing them to be replaced by temporary foreign workers i dont believe that paul ryans position on immigration is consistent with what is in the best interest of america brooks told breitbart but thats why we have these policy debates and disagreements i would prefer someone who is stronger on immigration but paul ryan has assured me again for this next session of congressas he did during the last year in which he was speaker that no bill on immigration will come to the house floor unless a majority of the gop conference supports it breitbart news followed up breitbart well last year he did put into the omnibus an expansion to the h b visa program even though he made that promise brooks i understand breitbart do you think hell keep his promise this time better than last time brooks i dont know following ryans broken promise congressman brooks took to the house floor in january and declared house speaker paul ryan claims increasing foreign worker visas quote helps small businesses who cannot find labor when theres a surge in demand for their labor like seafood processing or tourism end quote this claimed labor shortage is unsupported by jobs or wage data and is political bunk mr speaker while these surges in foreign worker visas and foreign labor work permits is a huge victory for special interests that profit from suppressed wages it is a debilitating loss for struggling american families brooks said unemployed and underpaid americans desperate for a good paying job have every right to be angry at a federal government that takes american jobs from american citizens and gives them to foreigners perhaps presciently brooks added americans have every right to be angry at washington elected officials who care more about special interest campaign contributions than american voters who elected us i hope these americans will remember their anger during s primary and general elections that is the way to force washington to represent us mr speaker i cant speak for anyone else but as for me mo brooks from alabamas th congressional district i fight for the economic interests of american citizens and against policies that undermine the struggling american voters who sent us here brooks concluded according to pew polling data  percent of the gop electorate is opposed to ryans expansionist immigration agenda reports analyzing trumps historic upset suggest that the american people did indeed remember their anger over ryan and political elites expansionist immigration policies that put foreign interests ahead of the interests of american workers yet brooks now indicates he is undecided on whether he will vote to re elect as house speaker a man who has been one of washingtons biggest advocates of open borders the speakers race all really comes down to one thing brooks says you can throw out the public policy you can throw out all the personalities it comes down to whether donald trump wants paul ryan as speaker of the house when asked if he thinks his constituents who just propelled trump to victory want ryan as house speaker brooks said my constituency wants donald trumps wishes respected as to his own preferences brooks explained i strongly prefer strong aggressive leadership on behalf of republican ideas rather than wishy washy compromising leadership in the context of the speakers race if hillary clinton had been elected president we would definitely need a house speaker with a stronger backbone than ryan yet as proponents of immigration controls have noted ryan has demonstrated that he can be quite forceful when it comes to his efforts to push for expansionist immigration policies there is nobody around in the party who is more fanatically dedicated to the cause of open borders than paul ryan conservative reviews daniel horowitz has explained whereas most others could be talked off the ledge on this issue ryan is a true believer open borders is in his ideological dna roy beck the president of the immigration control group numbersusa has explained hes an ideologue and has spent his whole life working for ideologues open borders seeps out of every pore of his being this isnt personal its just who he is ryan is the heart and soul of crony capitalism indeed brooks himself seemed to suggest that if ryan were elected speaker much of trumps efforts to enact his mandate on curbing immigration may have to be done against the wishes of speaker ryan when asked about ryans recent comments on cnn in which ryan indicated that the removing illegal aliens is not going to be a focus of a trump administration brooks said the president of the united states can enforce our immigration laws without any help from the united states congress the laws are already on the books so if donald trump wants to secure our border and enforce our immigration law he has the power to do that regardless of what the majority leader of the senate or the speaker of the house may think do or say i strongly disagree with him ryan on whether the importation of huge amounts of foreign labor is good for struggling american families brooks added i believe it costs struggling america families jobs and those lucky enough to get jobs will suffer from wage suppression as a consequence of the floodgates having been opened not only for illegal aliens but also for lawful immigrants if we had a booming economy it would be one thing but we dont we have an anemic economy and americans are suffering because of our open borders policy the economic data is clear and irrefutable all americans regardless of whether they are african american hispanic america asian america or caucasian american have been hurt by the huge influx of foreign labor that takes jobs from american citizens and hurts the wages of those americans fortunate enough to get jobs reports have documented ryans longstanding support for the low wage high immigration policies desired by the partys donor class despite the vocal objection of his republican constituents ryan championed an omnibus spending bill last year that fully funded president obamas immigration agendaincluding funding for sanctuary cities unconstitutional executive amnesty the resettlement of illegal aliens within the united states the release of criminal aliens tax credits for illegal aliens and a controversial expansion of obamas refugee resettlement operation dating back to his time as a capitol hill staffer in the mid s ryan was part of the effort to derail the bipartisan immigration curbs inspired by civil rights leader and late democratic congresswoman barbara jordan in  paul ryan worked hand in hand with open borders advocate luis gutierrez to push the obama rubio amnesty agenda gutierrez has previously said i have only one loyaltyand thats to the immigrant community at a joint event with gutierrez in  ryan made the case for dissolving bordersdeclaring unabashedly that america is more than our borders in fact in  gutierrez was one of ryans earliest supporters for his election as house speaker it is unclear whether members of the house freedom caucus and conservative lawmakersincluding jim jordan mark meadows jeff duncan jim bridenstine brian babin steve king matt salmon alex mooney gary palmer barry loudermilk john fleming and otherswho voted for ryan last year share gutierrezs previously expressed support for ryan and whether they will vote to elect him again as house speaker on tuesday comment

partial transcript as follows karl can you give us an update on what exactly happened as you understand it in portland overnight what happened with the shooting who was killed wolf well were still waiting obviously for that investigation to unfold i do understand that there were a number of counterprotests and countergroups in portland overnight and i think this points to a larger issue that we have seen in portland for the last three months and that is local and state officials not allowing law enforcement to do their job and really to bring this violent activity night after night after night to a close and so what  as you see that continue to unfold over the course of three months you are going to continue to see violent activity and we have asked the governor we have asked the mayor to step in if they dont have the resources the president has been very clear on this as you know we will  happy to provide resources to bring this violence to an end violence that again across the ideological spectrum left or right the violence needs to end karl so i saw the president was up and tweeting about this before  am its clearly front and center on his mind is he planning on doing something is there a consideration of sending in more federal law enforcement even in the defiance of local leaders wolf i believe all options continue to be on the table specifically as we talk about portland what we have seen in wisconsin minnesota and other places is those governors stepping up calling in the national guard the state national guard in many instances obviously wisconsin were sending in department of justice law enforcement officers as well so when we talk about portland again they continue to refuse federal  any type of federal assistance to bring that violent activity going on for almost  days now  a little over  days to a close the citizens of portland want this we need to bring some normalcy back to portland and again if the state and local officials wont do it they need to ask for assistance from the federal government karl do you have a message to those trump supporters we saw parading into portland last night weve seen images of apparent trump supporters seeming to fire paintballs at protesters pepper spray whats your message to those groups wolf my message to any individual to any group if you are going to protest first amendment right please do that peacefully once you cross the line to violence that is whats concerning to the department of homeland security thats what im focused on making sure that we bring any type of violence in any of our cities to a close follow pam key on twitter pamkeynen please let us know if you re having issues with commenting

in the main event cruz and trump are in a dead heat in iowa and both need to be careful to not alienate potential crossover supporters in the debate if they attack the other trump has raised the issue of whether cruz is a natural born citizen who is qualified to be president and cruz has the chance to put the issue to rest on the national state cruz has been attacking trumps new york values and it will be interesting to see whether cruz goes for a knockout punch which could also leave himself open to a counterpunch that could ko him against trump cruz needs to win iowa in order to have as much momentum as possible going into the sec primary cruzs organization in the south puts him in a strong position to do well but he needs to still be viable by then though trump has a huge lead in new hampshire one can argue that it makes complete sense for his campaign to go all in in iowa and seek to effectively end the gop primary with a big win there messrs bush christie kasich and rubio are battling in new hampshire to emerge as the trying to emerge as the establishments anti trumpcruz alternative and they may focus less on the frontrunners and more on highlighting their differences carson who has faded after being at the top of the polls and whose campaign is on the ropes must save his candidacy and needs a moment in this debate that will allow him to do so because there are fewer candidates on stage viewers may finally get a much more substantive debatediscussion devoid of much of the freak show elements of politics trish regan and sandra smith will moderate the undercard debate neil cavuto and maria bartiromo will moderate the main event stay tuned to breitbart news for live updates closing statements trump says he stood yesterday with  construction workers

stupid deals anymore and we will win on everything we do if he is president cruz says that  hours will debut tomorrow about the brave men who fought for their lives in benghazi and the politicians who betrayed them cruz blasts obama for not saying radical islamic terrorism and sending billions to iran he blasts clinton for apologizing for saying all lives matter cruz says this will end on january  and he will have the backs of soldiers sailors airmen marines police officers and first responders and firefighters who risk their lives to keep us safe rubio says america was founded on the principle that our rights come from god and not from government rubio says as he travels the country people tell him that they feel like they are being left behind he says the reason is simplein  america elected a president who wants to change america instead of fixing america and make it more like the rest of the world rubio accuses obama of undermining the constitution and betraying our allies a solid closing argument from rubio carson says that in his recent travels around the country he has encountered so many americans who are discouraged and angry because americas freedoms are slipping away he says were not going to solve this problem with traditional politics but with we the people carson says we will heal inspire and revive america for our children christie says he his thinking about the americans who watched obama talk about fantasyland when they know that the country is not respected anymore he says obama doesnt feel their pain and christie will be a fighter for this country again he talks about how he has been a fighter his whole life he says we will make america much more exceptional by making sure hillary clinton never gets in the white house bush says results count and americans can count on him to keep america safer stronger freer he cites his record in florida and his detailed plans on isis bush asks for support to build together a safer stronger america kasich says he has fought to give voice to people who grew up with him and those who elected him he talks about welfare reform pentagon reform taking on special interests in the nursing home industry in ohio he says thats who is in his minds eye and he will continue to fight for those who think they can get their voice back  pm bartiromo finally asks rubio about immigration she says under current law america is on pace to issue more green cards in the next five years than the entire population of south carolina she notes that the cbo found that his gang of eight bill would have increased green cards by another ten million she asks him bluntly why are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when american workers have a hard enough time finding work rubio says the issue has been debated for  years his mind is spinning on how to avoid answering the question he says the immigration question has to be about keeping america safe he says radical islamic jihadists are recruiting doctors engineers and even fiancees he says americas top priority should be to not let isis get terrorists into the united states bartiromo just asked the question because she had to but does a terrible follow up job the debate could have had a very substantive discussion on immigrationeconomy but predictably viewers did not get that rubio says the issue is a dramatically different issue than it was  months ago he says the entire legal immigration system must be reexamined for security reasons cruz says radical islamic terrorism was not invented  months ago he notes that he stood with messrs sessionsking to stop rubios amnesty bill because border security is national security rubio accuses cruz of having supported doubling the number of green cards and increasing guest workers by  rubio says cruz used to support legalizing illegal immigrants and birthright citizenship and now you oppose it he says that is not consistent conservatism he slams cruz for calling snowden a great public servant he says every time there is a defense bill in the senate rand paul bernie sanders and cruz team up to vote against it cruz says he appreciates rubio dumping his oppo research folder cruz says that rubio stood with schumerobama on amnesty and he stood with sessionsking cruz points out that rubio still supports amnesty for illegal immigrants taking rubio to task and holding rubio accountable in a way that the moderators should have immigration is the top issue in the gop primary there should have been much more time devoted to a substantive debate on the matter absolutely terrible pm pro rand paul protesters briefly interrupt cavuto as he asks kasich a question about chicagos move to retrain police officers to not use their guns as quickly he says he created a task force to bring together law enforcement community members the clergy etc kasich says they sat down as a group and gave him  recommendations one of them he says is statewide guidelines on the use of deadly force another is on hiring and recruiting and more resources for training he says there needs to be more integration between communitypolice he says the community needs to understand that the police officer wants to get home at night and not to lose their life and the police needs to understand that there are people in the community think the system doesnt work for them and actually works against them kasich says people need to realize that protest is fine but violence is wrong  pm cavuto asks christie about violent crime spiking in cities across the country and what he would do to address that and the concerns police have about being sued etc christie says fbi director jim comey said a chill wind is blowing through law enforcement because obama and both of his attorneys general gives the benefit of the doubt to the criminal and not the police officer christie says obama believes law enforcement are the bad guys christie says sanctuary cities are a part of the problem he blasts obama for not enforcing marijuana laws christie says he would appoint an attorney general and would order his ag to enforce the law against everyone justly aggressively fairly and let police officers know how proud we are of them  pm bartiromo asks trump how difficult it will be to disentangle himself from his businessmoney and prioritize americas interest first if i become president i couldnt care less about my company its peanuts trump says he says he wants to make america rich and great again and he has his children run the company im going to do it for america trump says trump says his children and executives would run his companiesholdings and would not care about anything except america  rubio is asked about entitlement reform rubio says the tax issue is related to the entitlement issue he differentiates himself from cruz by saying he will not have a value added tax rubio says the vat tax is a way to blindfold the people so the true cost of government is not there for them rubio says what is there to prevent a future liberal congresspresident from raising the income tax and the vat tax if it is instituted he says he is going to side with ronald reagan and not nancy pelosi on the issue cruz says that marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks but his business flat tax is not a vat tax cruz says the  business flat tax will allow for the death tax the corporate income tax the payroll tax the obamacare taxes cruz says his tax plan gives every american a simple flat tax rate of  he says rubios top tax rate is  and enables americans to fill out their taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the irs while rubios leaves the irs in place we need to break the washington cartel he says and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all the mandates and have a simple flat tax cruz says that art laffer has praised cruzs tax plan as the best rubio claims that he is not accurately describing his plan because there will be some agency that will collect what he says is cruzs vat tax he warns against a liberal administrationcongress raising the incomevat tax now we have europe he says christie says he is the only one on the stage who put forth a detailed entitlement reform program that will save social securitymedicare without raising taxes  carson is asked about us companies having  trillion overseas he is asked what he will do stop companies from leaving america because of its high corporate tax rate carson talks up his flat tax plan he says we have to stop spending so much money and fix the taxation system get rid of regulations because every regulation is a tax on goods and services and its the most regressive tax there is carson says the evil government and not the evil rich people that are destroying the

time  tax on repatriated funds will be dedicated to building up ameriacas infrastructure and creating more american jobs christie says obama has penalized corporations in america and what that does is hurt hard working taxpayers trump says jeb would be a weak president his low energy jab on jeb was ko shot trump blasts the new york times for saying that he would impose a  tariff on china he says that china has total control of north korea and they can solve the problem of north korea if they wanted to but instead they taunt us he says china is ripping us on tried they are devaluing their currencies and theyre killing our companies he says america has lost   million jobs because of china and cites americas  billion trade deficit with china trump says we have great economic power over china and if we wanted to use that he says the  tariff figure would balance chinas devaluing its currency caveat asks trump whether he would be open to tariffs on chinese goods and he rarely sidesteps the question as cavuto tries to pin him down trump says that china taxes american when it deals with american goods trump says since we dont have an equal playing field we dont have to lose  billion for the privilege of trading with china trump says he is totally open to a tariff if china doesnt treat us fairly he says he is a free trader but this is not fair trade candidates are asked whether america should push the pause button on muslim immigration kasich says he is for a pause on syrian refugees but we dont want to put everybody in the same category christie says we should take no syrian refugees of any kind because we cannot guarantee proper vetting but he says that you cant just ban all muslims you have to ban radical islamic jihadists rubio says that obama has underestimated the threat of radical islam if we do not know who you are and we do not know why you are coming when i am president you are not getting into the united states of america another non answer from professional politician rubio cruz says we need a commander in chief who is focused on keeping this country safe he says we pass legislation that strips citizenship from americans who go and fight with isis the senator doesnt really answer the question and sounds like a senator but ends by saying we will not let in refugees controlled by isis and al qaeda more viewer friendly to say this first

muslim ban  trump is asked about his temporary muslim ban bartiromo asks if there is anything he has heard that makes him want to rethink his position trump who always answers the question simple and directly says no we have to stop with political correctness we have to get down to creating a country that is not going to have the problems weve had with people flying planes into the world trade centers with the shootings in california trump mentions that he said temporarily and not permanently trump says some of his muslim friends have thanked him for highlighting the problem in islam we have a serious problem we cant be the stupid country anymore trump says bush asks trump to reconsider because it makes it impossible to build the coalition to take out isis i hope youll reconsider jeb says all muslims seriously what kind of signal does that send to the rest of the world that the united states is a serious player in creating peace and security jeb again says trumps comments are unhinged cavuto asks whether all the people who agree with trump are unhinged and jeb responds absolutely not when cavuto points out that trumps poll numbers went up after his temporary muslim ban trump responds  points in south carolina the man knows his polls trump says hes tired of seeing whats going on at the border and i want security for this country we have a serious problem with radical islam we have a tremendous problem trump says he wants to find out why the two horrible people in san bernardino murdered the innocent people who threw them a baby shower and why their neighbors didnt call the police he says the police are the most mistreated people in this country theres something going on and its bad and im saying we have to get to the bottom of it  carson says the obama administration does not recognize how serious isiss threat is he says america needs to take away isiss caliphate and we should give military officials what they need to destroy isis carson says that in addition to that we take isiss oil because it is their source of revenue echoing trump carson says we need to shut down their mechanisms of funding and attack their command and control centers

clinton and warns against the dangers of giving clinton who enabled isiss rise four years in the white house he says we have fewer democracies in the world since obama took office  cruz is asked to explain his new york values dig at trump he says that most people know exactly what new york values are bartiromo says she is from new york and cruz says since she is from new york she may not but people in south carolina do he says the values in new york city are socially liberal pr abortion pro gay rights focused around money and the media he says the concept of new york values is not too hard to figure out and cruz says trump explained some of his more liberal positions in the past because he is from new york cruz says that not a lot of conservatives come out of manhattan im just saying trump says that conservatives do come out of manhattan like william f buckley he then says that when  occurred in new york i saw something that no place on earth could have handled more beautifully more humanely than new york he saw the most horrific cleanup and the people of new york fought and fought we saw more death trump says that the smell of death was in the air and the city built itself back up i have to tell you that was a very insulting statement that ted made trump says regardless of trumps great answer on the question painting trump as a northerner will work in the south but it will be neutralized to some extent because there are folks that are still uncomfortable with the fact that cruz was born in canada trump could have in a friendly way talked about cruzs canadian citizenship and made a joke about it  trump is asked if there are any circumstances under wish we should be limiting gun sales no he says i am a second amendment person trump says if the san bernardino victims had guns many would not have died he agrees with jeb about the countrys mental health problem and he says that guns dont pull the trigger people pull the trigger trump says obama doesnt want to bring people together and his executive orders are proof of that rubio says that gun sales have increased under obama because people are afraid obama will take away their guns he says the second amendment is not an option but a constitutional right of every american to be able to protect themselves and their families rubio says that he is convinced that obama would confiscate all guns and get rid of the second amendment if he could cruz says you prosecute criminals and target bad guys to reduce gun violence he points out that attorney general eric holder said his mission was to brainwash the american people against guns cruz says obama also launched fast and furious he also says that hillary clinton agrees with the supreme court dissenters in the heller case who believe that the second amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever cruz says if their view prevails the supreme court will rule that not a single person has a right to bear arms and they will confiscate your guns cruz says that unless you are clinically insane every republican will say they support the second amendment in a gop primary cruz points out he has a record of defending the second amendment and points out that he led the opposition against obamas gun control legislation and the other individuals on the stage were nowhere to be found on that fight  jeb is asked about gun rights bush wants to recognize haley for what she did after the charleston shootings and the people in that church that showed the grace of god and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed bush says that in dylan roofs case the fbi made a mistake and didnt fulfill their part of the bargain on background checks he says we dont need to add new rules we just need to enforce the laws on the books he says the first impulse of obamaclinton is they want to rights away from law abiding citizens  carson is asked what he thinks about allegations that hillary clinton has been an enabler of bill clintons sexual misconduct carson says that there is no question that we should be able to look at any past president in terms of their past behavior and what it means carson says the real issue is whether america still has standards values and principles he speaks about all the divisiveness and hatred that is going on in society and says that our strength is in our unity he asks where the nastiness came from and says it it did not come from our judeo christrian roots carson says americans must recognize that there is a right and wrong and progressives should not be able to take that out of the culture  kasich is asked what is says about america when a self avowed socialist like sanders is catching fire kasich says that republicans will win every state if sanders is the nominee he says that wages havent risen because the fed has kept interest rates low and workers have not been given the skills they need he says workers are upset when they get fired when they are  and they do not know where to go he says we have to do a lot about the high cost of higher education and train people for good jobs that pay he says people are very concerned about their economic future and we have to make sure that every america has the tools and people can think the american dream still exists  rubio when asked about sliming christie says obama is undermining the constitutional basis of the united states and says we cannot have a president who supports common core and gun control rubio mentions that christie wrote a check to planned parenthood and our next president has to be someone that un does the damage barack obama has done to our country it cannot be someone that agrees with his agenda because the damage he has done to america is extraordinary if we dont get this election right there may be no turning back for america christie denies that he wrote a check to planned parenthood he says that he is not for more gun control and common core has been eliminated in his state he says since rubio is a senator he can just keep talking without any accountability christie says that two years ago rubio called christie a conservative reformer that new jersey needed and now rubio has changed his tune they are both really going after the new hampshire vote bush talks about a conservative agenda that doesnt disparage people because every person here is better than hillary clinton carson says he was mentioned because bush said everybody carson says that in  republicans tore themselves apart and we have to stop this if we manage to damage ourselves and we lose the next election and a progressive gets in there and they get two or three supreme court picks this nation is over as we know it we gotta look at the big picture here   trump is asked about haleys state of the union address and her comment about resisting the siren call of the angriest voices trump says that he is friends with haley he says that yes he is indeed very angry because our country is being run horribly i will gladly accept the mantle of anger trump says worth nothing that a university of michigan study found that anger indeed drives people to vote and trump is trying to get many first time voters and those who have not participated in elections to vote for him he says our military is a disaster our healthcare is a horror show we have no borders our vets are being treated horribly illegal immigration is beyond belief our country is being run by incompetent people and yes i am angry and i wont be angry when we fix it and until we fix it i am very very angry trump says haley spoke the truth and didnt find it offensive because hes angry because our country is a mess  cavuto says that cruz is strict constitutionalist he asks the natural born citizen question cavuto notes that trump and others have said that cruz is not a natural born citizen heres the full exchange here courtesy of joel cruz says im glad were focusing on the important topics of the evening he says that back in september trump said his lawyers said there was nothing to this birther issue he says since september the constitution hasnt changed but the poll numbers have i recognize that donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in iowa but the facts and the law here are really clear the child of a us citizen born abroad is a natural born citizen a great answer from cruz much better than his explanation about his  million loan cruz says some of the more extreme birthers say that a natural born citizen must have two parents born on us soil he says under that theory cruz rubio bobby jindal and interestingly enough donald j trump would be disqualified because donalds mother was born in scotland she was born here on the issue of citizenship donald im not going to use your mothers birth against you cruz says trump answers because it wouldnt work trump says that nbcwall street journal just came out with a poll headlined trump way up cruz going down after the crowd boos trump says they dont like the wall street journal nbc but i like the poll trump says he is beating cruz in the last three iowa polls and accuses cruz of misrepresenting his poll numbers trump says he thinks he is going to win fair and square he says harvard law professor laurence tribe who was one of obamas earliest backers has questioned whether cruz is qualified to be president trump says the problem is that if trump chooses cruz as his vice presidential candidate the democrats sue because we cant take him along for the ride i dont like that the fact is and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field when the crowd boos trump quips they dont like that he beats the rest of the field because they want me i already know the democrats are going to be bringing a suit you have a big lawsuit over your head while youre running if you become the nominee who the hell knows if you can be serving in office so you should go out get a declaratory judgment let the courts decide trump says he says hes raising the issue now because hes been doing a little bit better he says now cruz has a  chance say what you want about trump but he is refreshingly honest about his tactics and doesnt talk like the traditional politician trump says that he has been defending the constitution his entire life before the supreme court and im not going to be taking legal advice from donald trump trump says he doesnt have to take it from your own professor trump says cruz says the chances of any litigation succeeding and proceeding on this is zero cruz adds that tribe was al gores lawyer and a major hillary supporter cruz says clintons supporters are attacking cruz because they want trump as the gop nominee and trump says he is happy to consider trump as his vp so if trump is right he can get the top job at the end of the day trump says he would go back to building buildings if it doesnt work out but he has a feeling that it will work out rubio apologizes for interrupting court tv and says this election has to be about reversing all the damage obama has inflicted on the country  cruz is asked about allegations that he did not disclose a  million loan from goldman sachs cruz tells bartiromo well maria thank you for passing on that hit piece on the front page of the new york times he rails against the new york times and the mainstream media that have been out to get him the new york times and i dont have the warmest of relationships he says cruz says that unlike clinton he doesnt have hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank he says his opponent david dewhurst in the senate put in  million and cruz had to put in money to defend himself against the attack ads and fund the campaign cruz says he and his wife took a loan against their assets to defend themselves against the attack ads and says he made a paperwork error if thats the best hit the new york times has got they better go back to the well he says cruz needed a more succinct explanation his answer was too much in the weeds he sounds like a senator and when you are explaining like a senator you are losing to viewers  trump is asked about syrian refugees its not fear and terror its reality trump says of the threat of terrorism he says you have to look at indonesia san bernardino paris trump says the syrian doctor who obama said is the real face of the refugees is not representative trump says the refugees can be the great trojan horse he said when he looked at the migration line there were very few women and children and there were strong powerful men young he says people are looking at that and saying whats going on  trump says we are  trillion in debt and we cant let all these refugees come in and break our borders we just cant do it he says breitbart editor at large joel pollak on cruz sen ted cruz r tx fielded the first question of the gop debate in charleston south carolina when he was asked a question about jobs he took the opportunity to preface his answer by slamming president barack obama for ignoring the plight of ten us navy sailors who had been seized by iran on tuesday moderator maria bartiromo asked cruz to respond to president barack obamas contention in the state of the union address that those talking about an economic decline in america were peddling fiction cruz answered let me starti want to get to the substance of the question on jobs but i want to start with something today many of us picked up our newspapers and we were horrified to see the sight of ten american sailors on their knees with their hands on their heads in that state of the union president obama didnt so much as mention the ten sailors that had been captured by iran president obamas preparing to send  billion dollars or more to the ayatollah khamenei and i tell you it was heartbreaking but the good news is the next commander in chief is standing on this stage applause and i give you my word if i am elected president no serviceman or servicewoman will be forced to be on their knees in any nation that captures our fighting men and women well field the full force and fury of the united states of america applause the sailors were freed wednesday after being paraded on iranian television cruz went to talk about the obamaclinton economy that has left behind the working men and women of america while enriching a circle of cronies in washington dc  next up is carson he is asked how america attacks a network that does not accept national borders carson says he is glad to get a question this early on he says that obama doesnt realize that we live in the st century and war is different from how it was before he says we have dirty bombs cyber attacks and people who will be attacking our electrical grid  cavuto asks rubio how he would define the terror threat rubio like everyone else doesnt answer the initial question and says hillary is disqualified to be president of the united states he says someone who mishandles intelligence information and lies to the families of the benghazi victims can never be president of the united states rubio says that obama thinks america is an arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size he says that is why we have a foreign policy in which america cuts deals with iran betrays israel and apologizes for america rubio says there is a war against radical jihadists and either they win or we win rubio says if america captures any isis member alive they are getting a one way ticket to guantanamo bay cuba  next question for jeb still nothing for trump bush says that the idea that we are somehow better off today than when obama was elected is totally an alternative universe he says the world has been torn asunder he says obama talks about red lines with grandiose language but does nothing to follow it up bush says obama is missing the point that america leadership is required to have peace and stability in the world and speaks about peace through strength and how the obama administration has gutted the nations military he says our enemies dont fear us and our friends no longer think we have their backs bush says if clinton gets elected hillary may be going back and forth between the white house and the courthouse  christie is asked where and when a president should use military action to restore order still no question for trump christie says on tuesday night he watched story time with barack obama and it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing christie says we have to strengthen our alliances around the world and our allies need to be able to count on our word he says the one thing that has never been said about him is that he is misunderstood he says the adversaries have to understand the limits of our patience christie says it was absolutely disgraceful that the iran situation showed our relations were getting better and tried to spin the ten american soldiers who were forced to their knees as something positive christie when pressed on the original question says he will use military action if it is absolutely necessary to protect american lives and interests around the world he says though that america is not the worlds police force  kasich says commonsense regulations tax cuts and balanced budgets grow the economy he touts the balanced budget that he help orchestrate when he was in congress  the first question on the economy goes to cruz he sidesteps the question and says americans were horrified to see the ten american sailors on their knees he says obama is preparing to send hundreds of billions of iran and did not mention the sailors in his state of the union address he says if he is elected president americans will not be on their knees and any nation that captures our men and women will face the full force of the united states of america on the question he says obama tried to paint a rosy situation because washington lobbyists are doing great under obama but the workforce participation rate is dismal he says the obama administration has left behind the working men and women of this country oo pm the seven candidates now take the stage  pm the main event is about to begin and republican national committee chair says the party will support whomever the nominee is  santorum says america is frustrated and angry and looking for someone who is a fighter and a winner he says there is one person in the race that has taken on hillary clinton on partial birth abortion he says he is going to take some of rand pauls time and says he has fought clinton on iran sanctions he says he ran against the clinton machine in  and won against the carvillebegala machine huckabee says he also fought the clinton machine he says he spent the first half of his adult life raising a family and understanding how tough it is for people to make it he says he understood then that america needed politicians who havent spent their whole lives running for office he says there needs to be leadership that addresses the moral issues of our country he asks politicians say god bless america at the end of every political speech and asks how can we do that when we continue to slaughter  babies a day he wants to be a president who protects the unborn under the thth amendments fiorina says her husband frank was excited the other day because he was introduced as her eye candy she says americans would pay to see a debate between her and hillary clinton fiorina says she has been told all her life to sit down and be quiet settle and dont challenge the system she says americans are being told to sit down and be quite about our god about our guns about the abortion industry settle for illegal immigration that has been a problem for decadesaccept a system of government and politics that no longer works for us i will not sit down and be quiet and neither will you so i ask you to stand with me fight with me vote for me give fiorina credit on this she often has the best closing statements and changes them and keeps them fresh up unlike rubio who says the same thing every time but theres something about her that is a little too mechanical replace hillary clinton with fiorina in obamas vote different ad that was a remake of the famous  apple ad and it would work just as well  santorum talks up robert putnams our kids its a great book he says the liberal sociologist sought to write about the hollowing out of the middle class and discovered after studying all of the information that the biggest reason we are seeing the hollowing out of the middle of america is the breakdown of the american family this is one of santorums strongest areas and he says weve been too politically correct in this country because we dont want to offend anybody to fight for the lives of our children santorum says obama should use his bully pulpit to ask america to rebuild the american family because that will change the economy extremely strong momentanswer from santorum that message on rebuilding the american family is something that resonates across partyracialethnic lines  huckabee is asked about automation and how it threatens workers ability to get higher wages he says the reason so many people have a tough time getting ahead is that the tax system punishes americans as they move up the economic ladder he again uses his time to speak up the fair tax  fiorina is asked about the widening income gap and restoring the middle class that is no longer the majority she says that when government gets bigger the rich get richer the poor get poorer and the middle class gets squeezed fiorina talks bout reforming the tax code focusing on every single dollar the government spends  huckabee is asked how the country can pay down its debt without cutting social securitymedicare he says social security is not the governments money it belongs to the people who had it taken out of their checks involuntarily their entire working lives for the government to say well its the fault of the working people that we have a social security problem no its the fault of the government that used those peoples money for something other than protecting those peoples accounts lets not blame them and punish them huckabee says working until  is great for white collar people with a desk jobs but its a different story for laborers huckabee then speaks about the fair tax that will super charge the economy  santorum we need to be the party that stands for the american worker santorum says americas numbers dont add up re adding manufacturing jobs he says obama has done more to take jobs away from hard working people who are struggling the most santorum says the  of americans who dont have a college degree will end up paying for obamas free community college program he says nobody is focused on the people who are struggling the most in america today santorum then turns to immigration he says wages are flattening because nearly all illegal immigrants and most legal immigrants are working in wage earning jobs he says it is unfortunate that most of the candidates in the field and both political parties favor amnesty and allowing illegal immigrants to stay here while increasing levels of legal immigration we need to be the party that stands for the american worker he says  santorum is asked about how vulnerable americas infrastructure is to terrorism santorum warns against electromagnetic pulse attacks and he says the best way to prevent that from happening is to make sure iran doesnt get a nuclear weapon so they cant explode a device over out atmosphere he says obama has put iran on a path toward a nuclear weapon while america has done nothing to harden our electric grid so american can survive an emp attack  huckabee obama more interested in protecting the reputation and image of islam than he is in protecting us huckabee says its time to look at americas visa waiver program he points out that the european union is a failure and is making europe less safe he says our first and foremost responsibility is to protect america and americans and he says obama who seems to be more interested in protecting the reputation and image of islam than he is in protecting us he says obama needs to read his own fbi crime stats that say that  of religious hate crimes have been directed toward jews last year while  were directed towards muslims he says maybe obama should have spoken out against the the rise of anti semitic comments huckabee says a slowed down commerce that makes america more safe is worth it re stopping the visa waiver program he blasts obama for promising americans they can keep their doctors and insurance plans he says the latest is if you like your gun you can keep it too and frankly we dont buy it we dont believe it hes lost his credibility  huckabee is asked if there is anything that can be done at the federal level to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals he says the government should never do anything idiotic like fast and furious where the us government put guns in the hands of mexican drug lords that resulted in the death of border patrol agent brian terry huckabee says there is no gun show loophole and he blasts obama for saying it is easier to get guns than groceries he says it is much more difficult to purchase firearms than to get ingredients for a salad at the grocery store huckabee says obama keeps retrying things that dont work on gun violence and says that one common thing re the mass shootings is that they happened in gun free zones and people who could have stood up and tried to stop the attacks were not allowed to under the law  fiorina is asked about obamas executive orders on gun control she blasts obamas lawless executive order and says obama is again trying to unilaterally override what he could not get passed in congress sorry mr president not the way the constitution works she says fiorina says we need to enforce the laws we have she then takes the technology question that santorum was asked she says bureaucracies do not know how to innovate and there are specific things the private sector should be asked to do to help the government since it has the capabilities the government does not have she also says america must have a president who understands technology mrs clinton you cannot wipe a server with a towel she says  santorum says a lot of technologists are very skilled but they are not war fighters he says america need more leadership on how to go on the offensive against our enemies online he says americas enemies who launch cyberattacks are not punished he says it is dicey for government to force companies like facebooktwitter to do the job that the us government should be doing its interesting that so much of the economic debate has centered around foreign policy if the questions focus more on the economy i wonder if any of the candidates will mention the late great roger milliken who always put american workers first especially since the debate is taking place in south carolina  fiorina is asked about the savages who raped gang raped german women on new years eve many of the perpetrators were asylum seekers and she says we cannot allow refugees to enter this country unless we can adequately vet them and we know we cant therefore we should stop allowing refugees in this country differentiating herself from nikki haley fiorina also says we do not need to be lectured about why we are angryfrustrated because weve had an illegal immigration problem for the last  years she says americans also have a right to be angry at politicians who promise change and never fulfill them  huckabee says radical islam is a threat to every civilized person on this earth he says we need to be equipping the kurds and never spend a drop of american blood unless there is a clearly defined goal he speaks about rebuilding our navy and strengthening the military to win wars when huckabee is asked whether america needs to be in afghanistan he says only if there is a concerted effort to destroy radical islamists who are intent on destroying america he says the role of the us military is not to build schools but to kill our enemies and make americans safe  santorum is asked about saudi arabiairan relations santorum says the iran deal needs to be torn up on the first day of the new presidency he says that iran has already torn up the agreement and has already violated the terms of the agreement by launching ballistic missiles he says it is pathetic that obama backed down on iran sanctions santorum asks the citadel cadets to stand and says he wants to tell each one of them if you choose to serve this country i will have your back i will not let america be trampled upon anymore by these radical jihadists  fiorina says america has refused to respond to irans provocations and those of north korea she says well get more provocation and bad behavior if america continues to ignore bad behavior from its adversaries  pm est candidates are asked about their assessment of the economy fiorina says she is honored to be standing with two former iowa caucus winners fiorina says unlike another woman in the race i actually do love spending time with my husband huckabee says president barack obama should have stood in line at the layaway counter and with those who clean his campaign headquarters in arkansas to find out that there are a lot of people hurting in his economy santorum says obama needs to listen to the democratic debate to find out how bad the economy is doing he says democrats have been in control for the last seven years and the jobs that fill the middle have been lost under obamademocrats no matter how hard fiorina tries to frame herself as the outsider politician who will shake up the system voters just arent buying it they get the sense that she has establishmentpolitician written all over her her ridiculous rose bowl tweet rooting against her alma mater in favor of iowa a football team she may have never even followed just reinforced the suspicious voters have about her  pm est huckabee fiorina and santorum take the stage paul is absent and he may regret it as he would have finally had the time to articulate his libertarian leaning views on government surveillance and foreign policy and how they differ from those of his opponents paul
